Our Client

We are a venture-backed startup building the infrastructure layer for Property & Casualty (P&C) insurance. Integrating technology in the insurance industry today is much like consumer finance pre-Plaid (we could succinctly be described as ""Plaid for Insurance""), or payments pre-Stripe, and our vision is to unlock a similar wave of innovation for the $2T global P&C industry.

Today, walking into an insurance agency is like stepping into a time machine. Filing cabinets, fax machines, piles of incoming and outgoing mail. What you don't see is that even for the parts that have been ""digitized"", needless manual work abounds. Few systems communicate directly, leading to endless copy-pasting from emails to various proprietary web portals/desktop apps and back again.

Carrier by carrier, endpoint by endpoint, we will bring each of those manual and error-prone workflows into our simple, modern API layer.

The implementation details are subject to change, but this is our north star, and the future we envision isn't possible without it.

What we're looking for

We are seeking a highly autonomous engineer (employee #2!) excited about owning the design and implementation of a robust, API-driven product and playing a foundational role in the formation of the company.

Responsibilities
You'll work closely with the team and early customers to build a world-class, API-driven product.
You'll solve hard technical problems from scratch, owning the solution through the entire development lifecycle.
You'll help define the tech stack/architecture for a fledgling product — we're technology agnostic and focus using the right tool for the job.
You'll contribute to the creation of the team culture, as well as internal tooling and processes.
Role requirements
4+ years professional backend/full-stack engineering experience. Working on large-scale open-source projects works too. You've played significant roles in either API design, building processing pipelines, or systemic integration of external systems.
Early-stage startup experience (or other similar unstructured, fast-paced environment)
Live in or willing to relocate to the Bay Area to work full-time in our SF office
Nice to haves
Experience with web scraping, email scraping, RPA — in general just getting data creatively out of hard-to-reach places
1+ years TypeScript/JavaScript experience in a professional or large-scale OSS setting. If you have a comprehensive side project you think is equivalent, send it our way! Clear, concise, and extensible code is important to us and collaborating with others is often a forcing function to that end.
Experience integrating with low tech industries, or other time spent integrating with poorly documented, antiquated APIs (and sometimes even a lack thereof)
Why you should join us
Opportunity to be a foundational team member to a well-funded, post-product and -revenue startup in a massive and largely untapped industry.
Hard backend engineering problems on day 1. Backend is all we do, and the projects you'll work on will be challenging and interesting.
Generous equity comp (90th+ percentile) and competitive cash comp (50th percentile). As we're a startup, we're happy to play with the balance for exceptional candidates.
The Founding Team

Our CEO is a strong engineer in his own right (Waterloo grad, senior eng at multiple Bay Area startups) but will be focusing on the business/product side. He’s gone super deep on insurance, including getting a Broker License and a stint as an Insurtech EIR at a top VC firm.

We’ve raised funding from great investors including top seed funds, ex-Plaid folks, and insurance industry insiders.

Hydrologic Data Scientist (Geohydrology Program),"University of Kansas
","Lawrence, KS",-1,4.3,"Position Overview
The Kansas Geological Survey (KGS) at the University of Kansas (KU) is seeking a hydrologic data scientist to develop and lead a research program of international stature using cutting-edge data science and geostatistical techniques to investigate water resources questions of relevance to Kansas. Specific areas of research expertise may include, but are not limited to: machine learning, deep learning, or artificial intelligence approaches applied to investigations of water resources; work on water quantity and/or quality in groundwater and/or surface water systems; assessment of subsurface hydrostratigraphy; and data-driven investigations of hydrogeology, hydrology, or ecohydrology in human-dominated landscapes. While these are areas of potential focus, demonstrated research excellence and future research potential are more important than the candidate’s specific area of specialization.

Scientists at the KGS are hard-funded, faculty-equivalent academic staff with sabbatical eligibility. Scientific staff are expected to develop research programs that are of international stature and highly relevant to Kansas, with similar standards to academic faculty in terms of research productivity, obtaining external funding to support projects, and advancement through ranks. Scientific staff also can teach and serve as advisors of graduate research, and typically have courtesy appointments with one or more academic departments. A candidate at the assistant scientist level is preferred, but exceptional applicants at the associate or senior scientist levels will also be considered.

About the KGS and KU:
The KGS is a research and service center at KU that conducts fundamental and applied research significant to Kansas. Within the KGS, the Geohydrology program conducts research on hydrologic and hydrogeochemical systems ranging in scale from site-specific to river basin and regional aquifers. The Geohydrology program has ~20 individuals including five full-time scientists, technical support personnel, graduate students, and postdocs. Current areas of research include: physical, stratigraphic, and geochemical characterization of sedimentary aquifer systems; surface-water/groundwater interactions; solute fate & transport in river networks; spatial data analysis/geostatistics; assessment of sustainable yields in complex hydrologic systems; simulation of flow and transport processes; technology for subsurface characterization; quantifying impacts of withdrawals and conservation strategies on water resources; and human-water interactions. The group maintains a program of public information and education and has extensive interactions with water research and management entities at the state, local, and federal levels.

The KGS is located on the KU campus amidst the rolling hills of Lawrence, Kansas. KU is an international, R1 research university, a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU) and Big 12 conference, and the flagship university for the state of Kansas. KU has a large water and environmental research community spread across campus with many opportunities for collaboration, including with the Departments of Geology; Geography and Atmospheric Science; Civil, Environmental, and Architectural Engineering; Ecology & Evolutionary Biology; and the Kansas Biological Survey. Lawrence is an eclectic town of ~100,000 people along the banks of the beautiful Kansas River with an excellent cultural scene, historic downtown, cutting-edge library, farmers market, and many delicious restaurants. Outdoor opportunities around town including biking, hiking, and boating. The big-city vibes and international airport of Kansas City are less than an hour away.

Required Qualifications
Ph.D. degree in natural sciences, engineering, or data science with a focus on water resources and/or hydrogeology. Degree must be completed prior to appointment start date.
Experience applying advanced data science techniques to investigate water resource problems, including working with and interpreting hydrologic or hydrogeologic data.
Strong quantitative theoretical training and demonstrated commitment to collaborative research.
Demonstrated ability or potential to provide scientific leadership in research on hydrologic data science.
Excellent written and oral communication skills, evidenced by a record of peer-reviewed publications and presentations.
