Quantitative Systematic Trader – Graduate,"Susquehanna International Group
","Bala Cynwyd, PA",-1,4.1,"We’re looking for quant-minded strategists who value the power of interdisciplinary knowledge and cooperative thinking. Our Quantitative Systematic Traders combine the skills of quantitative research with the knowledge of trading to develop new electronic strategies and monitor real-time performance. As a true hybrid of our core disciplines, Quantitative Systematic Traders are constantly communicating and connecting ideas between trading, technology, and quantitative research.

The general life cycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
As a Quantitative Systematic Trader, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
To assess the strength of that trading signal, you will run it through our backtesting environment and carefully analyze its performance.
If that signal produces profitable results, you will work side-by-side with technologists and put it into production.
Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will actively monitor its real-time performance in the financial markets.
As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.
We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

What we're looking for

Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
Solid, analytical problem-solving skills
Excellent logical reasoning
Exceptional communication skills, both in the ability to understand others and to make yourself clearly understood
Experience writing code to process and analyze large sets of data, especially in Python
Experience in C++ or other low level programming languages is a plus
Demonstrated interest in strategic games and/or competitive activities
Ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Researcher position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

Quantitative Researcher – Graduate,"Susquehanna International Group
","Bala Cynwyd, PA",$85K - $115K (Glassdoor est.),4.1,"We’re looking for accomplished researchers who are interested in growing their career in the field of quantitative finance. While the problems we solve at SIG are often different from academia, our problems demand the attention of brilliant minds that have an extraordinary attention to detail and a relentless pursuit of understanding.

The general lifecycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
As a Quantitative Researcher, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
You will work side-by-side with technologists in order to backtest your results and put that trading signal into production.
Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will continue to do research on that strategy in order to optimize its performance.
As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.
We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

What we're looking for

Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
Exceptional mathematical problem-solving skills
Solid communication skills, both in the ability to understand others and to make yourself clearly understood
Strong, practical computing skills; a specific language proficiency is less important than your ability to get computers to accomplish tasks efficiently and reliably
Experience working on in-depth research projects
Finance experience is not a requirement


By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Systematic Trader position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

Visa sponsorship is available for this position.

SIG does not accept unsolicited resumes from recruiters or search firms. Any resume or referral submitted in the absence of a signed agreement will become the property of SIG and no fee will be paid.

Description

The National Energy Technology Laboratory's (NETL's) record of success has been built on understanding the future of energy and the technologies required to make that future possible. We’ve long touted our success in developing the technologies that took on acid rain in the 1970s and mercury in the early 2000s. More recently, NETL has a leading role in President Biden’s ambitious climate goals, including a carbon emission-free power sector by 2035 and a net-zero economy by 2050.

Program Goals

The NETL Faculty Research Program (FRP) offers qualified academic faculty an opportunity to collaborate with NETL principal investigators on research that is mutually beneficial to NETL and the selected applicant at state-of-the-art NETL facilities. While typical appointments are part-time, some appointments are offered on a full-time basis during the summer or as a sabbatical. Prior to the appointment, the NETL principal investigator and selected applicant will define the scope of research and schedule the appointment period. Appointment periods range from one month to more than one year. Funding varies and is awarded based upon the participant's institutional salary. Faculty members are expected to elevate the collaboration with NETL by supporting connections with students at their home institution, in addition to the research project.

Connecting Students with NETL

The collaboration between the selected faculty member and NETL will include connecting their academic institution and students with NETL. Student connections may be fostered through activities such as, but not limited to, the following:

Inviting NETL scientists and engineers to present at a departmental seminar
Joining NETL at institutional career/job fairs to discuss your experiences with NETL
Speaking about your experiences with NETL at information sessions
Sharing invitations to NETL information sessions with students
Partnering with NETL on proposals and other funding opportunities
Recommending opportunities to NETL scientists and engineers, such as serving as a reviewer or editor, leading a workshop, etc.
Serving as an ambassador to NETL for students interested in careers in the national lab complex

Research Project

Through the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), this posting seeks a faculty collaborator to engage in projects with the Research Innovation Center (RIC) at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) in the area of carbon storage under the mentorship of Greg Lackey. This project will be hosted by the NETL Pittsburgh, PA campus.

There are estimated to be more than 6 million wells in the continental United States, of which approximately 1.16 million are abandoned (Saint-Vincent et al., 2020). Site developers and operators of geologic storage sites are responsible to characterize the hazard represented by legacy wells within the area of influence of their projects. Managing the risks of potential leakage from those wells during and after injection represents a technical challenge—particularly since robust methods to predict which wells present the greatest leakage risk are lacking. Developing and applying new data-driven methods to help prioritize well remediation, plugging, and monitoring efforts has the potential benefit of efficiently and effectively managing risk.

Gaining insights into the safety and security of geologic storage requires a combination of field and laboratory experimentation, numerical simulation of system behavior, practical perspective from analogous industrial experience, and insights drawn from data. Under this project researchers will apply artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) techniques to national-scale well characterization and integrity test datasets to yield new insights into leakage potential. It is intended that these insights will inform stakeholders’ decision making on risk management and help to ensure efficient and effective well inspection and plugging efforts.

The goals of this project are to: learn and apply state-of-art methods and approaches for well characterization and integrity assessment, well log analysis, and machine learning model development to address industry-relevant applied geoengineering problems; gain perspective on geologic carbon storage technology research front, key challenges, and stakeholder perspectives; gain exposure to career opportunities in energy and environmental science/engineering, with particular exposure to geologic and environmental-related fields; gain experience in collaborative research with, interdisciplinary collaboration teams; and improve technical writing and oral presentation skills.

Peer-reviewed publication is strongly encouraged and will be supported by the mentor and other collaborators, as it an important step for emerging researchers to establish themselves and contribute to the advancement of the state-of-understanding in their field of endeavor. It is not, however, a requirement for this opportunity.

Stipend: The selected faculty participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with their institutional salary.

Deliverables: To document the effectiveness of the program, participants are required to submit a pre-appointment and post-appointment survey, as well as a reflection on their appointment experience when they renew or end their appointment. The reflection should summarize their project(s), additional activities, and overall experience. Details are provided as the appointment end date approaches.
Participants may also have the opportunity to contribute to manuscripts, journal articles, book chapters, conference presentations, posters, patents, and other publications as a part of their appointment. Such achievements should also be reported to ORISE; additional details are provided after an offer has been accepted.

Our Client

We are a venture-backed startup building the infrastructure layer for Property & Casualty (P&C) insurance. Integrating technology in the insurance industry today is much like consumer finance pre-Plaid (we could succinctly be described as ""Plaid for Insurance""), or payments pre-Stripe, and our vision is to unlock a similar wave of innovation for the $2T global P&C industry.

Today, walking into an insurance agency is like stepping into a time machine. Filing cabinets, fax machines, piles of incoming and outgoing mail. What you don't see is that even for the parts that have been ""digitized"", needless manual work abounds. Few systems communicate directly, leading to endless copy-pasting from emails to various proprietary web portals/desktop apps and back again.

Carrier by carrier, endpoint by endpoint, we will bring each of those manual and error-prone workflows into our simple, modern API layer.

The implementation details are subject to change, but this is our north star, and the future we envision isn't possible without it.

What we're looking for

We are seeking a highly autonomous engineer (employee #2!) excited about owning the design and implementation of a robust, API-driven product and playing a foundational role in the formation of the company.

Responsibilities
You'll work closely with the team and early customers to build a world-class, API-driven product.
You'll solve hard technical problems from scratch, owning the solution through the entire development lifecycle.
You'll help define the tech stack/architecture for a fledgling product — we're technology agnostic and focus using the right tool for the job.
You'll contribute to the creation of the team culture, as well as internal tooling and processes.
Role requirements
4+ years professional backend/full-stack engineering experience. Working on large-scale open-source projects works too. You've played significant roles in either API design, building processing pipelines, or systemic integration of external systems.
Early-stage startup experience (or other similar unstructured, fast-paced environment)
Live in or willing to relocate to the Bay Area to work full-time in our SF office
Nice to haves
Experience with web scraping, email scraping, RPA — in general just getting data creatively out of hard-to-reach places
1+ years TypeScript/JavaScript experience in a professional or large-scale OSS setting. If you have a comprehensive side project you think is equivalent, send it our way! Clear, concise, and extensible code is important to us and collaborating with others is often a forcing function to that end.
Experience integrating with low tech industries, or other time spent integrating with poorly documented, antiquated APIs (and sometimes even a lack thereof)
Why you should join us
Opportunity to be a foundational team member to a well-funded, post-product and -revenue startup in a massive and largely untapped industry.
Hard backend engineering problems on day 1. Backend is all we do, and the projects you'll work on will be challenging and interesting.
Generous equity comp (90th+ percentile) and competitive cash comp (50th percentile). As we're a startup, we're happy to play with the balance for exceptional candidates.
The Founding Team

Our CEO is a strong engineer in his own right (Waterloo grad, senior eng at multiple Bay Area startups) but will be focusing on the business/product side. He’s gone super deep on insurance, including getting a Broker License and a stint as an Insurtech EIR at a top VC firm.

We’ve raised funding from great investors including top seed funds, ex-Plaid folks, and insurance industry insiders.

Job Profile Title
Data Analyst Senior
Job Description Summary
The University of Pennsylvania’s Crime and Justice Policy Lab (CJP) is hiring a Data Scientist with strong analytical skills to work who will be embedded in the Baltimore City State’s Attorney’s Office (BCSAO) Major Investigations Unit (MIU) to support the more effective prosecution of gun violence, particularly as part of Baltimore City’s Group Violence Reduction Strategy (GVRS). The MIU, a proactive prosecution unit, works closely with the Baltimore Police Department, Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the United States Attorney’s Office (USAO) and other criminal justice agencies, to prosecute individuals and groups driving gun violence.

This position is eligible for full university benefits. The Data Scientist will receive day-to-day supervision from the Chief of MIU and overall strategic direction from CJP’s Director of Violence Reduction Policy and Programs. The position runs until 12/31/24 with the possibility of extension based on funding availability or absorption by BCSAO.
Job Description
This position is working in the Crime and Justice Policy Lab (CJP), a research group within the University of Pennsylvania Department of Criminology. The mission of the CJP Lab is to apply rigorous methods of scientific research to improve public safety in disadvantaged communities, centering those communities in the design and execution of policy ideas, and ensuring that research and government policy is being done with communities rather than to communities. The end goal for our work is that citizens in Philadelphia and other major cities are able to enjoy safety and equitable treatment and outcomes in their day-to-day lives. CJP works primarily in Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore, Oakland, and San Francisco, and with several federal government partners and international partners in Latin America and the Caribbean.
CJP projects often pursue a “triple bottom line”—our successful projects are ones that reduce violence that is affecting communities, reduce incarceration, and lessen the burden of policing on communities by generating fewer and more just interactions between police and community members. As many of our projects directly work with the criminal justice system to achieve these goals, we need to be comfortable both holding the priorities of the communities we serve at the center of our work, while also being able to work productively with police and other groups.
CJP is part the University of Pennsylvania’s Criminology Department, where current faculty are highly regarded as teachers and researchers who represent a range of academic disciplines: psychology, sociology, economics, public policy, law, statistics, and criminology.
Background:
CJP has partnered with the Baltimore City Mayor’s Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement, the State’s Attorney’s Office and the Police Department to provide technical assistance, analytical and direct management support on its Group Violence Reduction Strategy (GVRS).

GVRS, also known as focused deterrence, is an evidence-based initiative designed to reduce serious violence. The strategy works by engaging directly with those most intimately involved in and affected by violence, leveraging an intentional collaboration between law enforcement, social services, and community members who collectively co-sign and deliver an anti-violence message to stop the shooting.
When implemented with fidelity, GVRS can achieve what few other strategies can: reducing homicides and non-fatal shootings, while simultaneously minimizing the criminal justice footprint and empowering communities in the co-production of public safety.
Baltimore’s flagship gun violence reduction strategy, GVRS produced a
33% reduction in homicides and shootings
in Baltimore’s historically violent Western police district and is currently in the process of moving to scale.
This position is based in Baltimore, Maryland (not Philadelphia).
Duties/Job Responsibilities:
The University of Pennsylvania’s Crime and Justice Policy Lab (CJP) is hiring a Data Analytics Program Manager with strong analytical skills to work who will be embedded in the Baltimore City State’s Attorney’s Office (BCSAO) Major Investigations Unit (MIU) to support the more effective prosecution of gun violence, particularly as part of Baltimore City’s Group Violence Reduction Strategy (GVRS). The MIU, a proactive prosecution unit, works closely with the Baltimore Police Department, Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the United States Attorney’s Office (USAO) and other criminal justice agencies, to prosecute individuals and groups driving gun violence.
The Data Analytics Program Manager will be responsible for supporting MIU and MIU investigations in a variety of ways, including:
Research, compile and organize intelligence information and statistics using various database systems, Internet searches, and other sources to support MIU investigations;
Develop links between violent individuals and violent groups or patterns of shootings for use by law enforcement personnel, City departments and other outside agencies;
Prepare graphic presentations of data (e.g., charts, graphs, and matrices)
Design, use and maintain databases and software applications, such as geographic information systems (GIS), social network and link analysis tools and artificial intelligence tools;
Develop structured analytical techniques and conclusions based on detailed research and analysis of intelligence information and data; and
Work with MIU leadership to propose and implement analytical approaches to solving specific questions.
This position is eligible for full university benefits. The Data Analytics Program Manager will receive day-to-day supervision from the Chief of MIU and overall strategic direction from CJP’s Director of Violence Reduction Policy and Programs. The position runs until 12/31/24 with the possibility of extension based on funding availability or absorption by BCSAO. This position is based in Baltimore, Maryland (not Philadelphia).

The NETL Postgraduate Research Program (PGRP) is a high-intensity program designed to identify recent Master’s and Doctoral graduates of high promise and to foster advanced skill development. It allows the postgraduate to systematically outline career goals and helps provide the means of achieving these goals. NETL principal investigators and leads serve as mentors to PGRP participants during the program. This interaction affords the postgraduate a unique opportunity to develop critical skills needed to become an independent professional.

The program goals include providing the opportunity to participants to:

Develop skills and knowledge in their field of study
Engage with new areas of basic and applied research
Network with world-class scientists
Exchange ideas and skills with the Laboratory community
Use state-of-the-art equipment
Contribute to answers for today's pressing scientific questions
Collaborate with the broader scientific and technical communities

Project Details

Through the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), this posting seeks a post-Doctoral or post-Master's researcher to engage in projects with the Research Innovation Center (RIC) at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) in the area of seismicity under the mentorship of Greg Lackey. This project will be hosted at the NETL Pittsburgh, PA campuses.

There are estimated to be more than 6 million wells in the continental United States, of which, approximately 1.16 million are abandoned. Site developers and operators of geologic storage sites are responsible for characterizing the hazard represented by legacy wells within the area of influence of their projects. Managing the risks of potential leakage from those wells during and after injection represents a technical challenge—particularly since robust methods to predict which wells present the greatest leakage risk are lacking. Developing and applying new, data-driven methods to help prioritize well remediation, plugging, and monitoring efforts has the potential benefit of efficiently and effectively managing risk.

Gaining insights into the safety and security of geologic storage requires a combination of field and laboratory experimentation, numerical simulation of system behavior, practical perspective from analogous industrial experience, and insights drawn from data. Under this project, researchers will apply artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) techniques to national-scale well characterization and integrity test datasets to yield new insights into leakage potential. It is intended that these insights will inform stakeholders’ decision making on risk management and help to ensure efficient and effective well inspection and plugging efforts. (More details about NETL’s Geologic and Environmental Systems Directorate can be found here: https://netl.doe.gov/onsite-research/geological. More details about NETL’s Advanced Carbon Storage Research and Development portfolio can be found here: https://netl.doe.gov/carbon-management/carbon-storage/advanced-storage)

The participant will: learn and apply state-of-the-art methods and approaches for well characterization and integrity assessment, well log analysis, and machine learning model development to address industry-relevant applied geoengineering problems; gain perspective on geologic carbon storage technology research front, key challenges, and stakeholder perspectives; gain exposure to career opportunities in energy and environmental science/engineering, with particular exposure to geologic and environmental-related fields; gain experience in collaborative research with interdisciplinary collaboration teams; and improve technical writing and oral presentation skills.

Peer-reviewed publication is strongly encouraged and will be supported by the mentor and other collaborators, as it an important step for emerging researchers to establish themselves and contribute to the advancement of the state-of-understanding in their field of endeavor. It is not, however, a requirement for this opportunity.

Stipend: The selected participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience.

Post-Master's stipends start at $3,720 per month.
Post-Doctoral stipends start at $5,518 per month.
Actual stipend rate offered may be increased based on experience.

Deliverables: To document the effectiveness of the program, participants are required to submit a pre-appointment and post-appointment survey, as well as a reflection on their appointment experience when they renew or end their appointment. The reflection should summarize their project(s), additional activities, and overall experience. Details are provided as the appointment end date approaches.
Participants may also have the opportunity to contribute to manuscripts, journal articles, book chapters, conference presentations, posters, patents, and other publications as a part of their appointment. Such achievements should also be reported to ORISE; additional details are provided after an offer has been accepted.
