About Vital Energy:

Based in Tulsa, OK, Vital Energy stands as a paragon of innovation within the upstream oil and gas sector. As a nexus between state-of-the-art technology and energy resource management, we have transformed the paradigm of operational efficacy through our innovative approaches. Not just a name, but a movement within the industry, Vital Energy epitomizes cutting-edge innovation, setting standards, and leading the charge with solutions that chart the future.

Our E&P Approach

In every aspect of our operations, we strive to optimize capital efficiency, so we can develop more assets, provide more jobs and bring more energy to the world to positively impact more lives. We continually refine our portfolio of holdings, acquiring acreage with high oil cuts and divesting lower-margin assets. We seek to create efficiencies in our approaches to drilling, completions, crews, materials, transport, and all other facets of our business. In the end, Vital Energy produces something beyond oil and gas. We create value for our stakeholders, and for every human empowered by the energy we help to bring forth.

High productivity, every acre

Vital Energy acquires and develops oil and gas resources in the largest and most productive hydrocarbon region in the world, the Permian Basin. We focus on this thriving area because it best meets our goal to make energy plentiful and accessible to humanity, responsibly, over the long term. While our current holdings are fully within the Permian, our acquisition and development strategy considers all high-margin assets that can help sustain our business and fuel our purpose.

Better decisions through digital

Vital Energy embraces digital transformation like no other company in our space. We believe the potential for profound progress in our industry is limitless. This is our mindset. And it has spurred us to make several high-impact advancements. A few highlights include:

Dynamic Routing | Using AI algorithms, we optimally route lease operators to the highest value opportunities in the field.
Emissions Prevention | Computer vision and thermal cameras detect flaring and venting events, prompting fast remediation and prevention of further releases.
Optimal Chemical Usage | Water rates are fed to the cloud and IoT devices automatically adjust chemical injection rates.
ESP Well Optimization | AI algorithms automatically adjust back pressure, pump speed and other settings to maximize production and well life.

This is just the beginning. We see immense opportunities to harness the power of data to drive efficiency, improve decision-making, so we can produce more energy in better ways to sustainably power our planet.
