We are looking for an experienced Senior Data Scientist to join our growing machine learning (ML) team at PerfectRec.

About PerfectRec

PerfectRec is a machine-learning powered decision engine focused on helping people find good, personalized recommendations without exhaustive research. Our goals are to get each person the best product for them, while saving time and money. We aim to attract billions of users, collectively save them billions and billions of hours on their product searches, and provide a similar amount of value by guiding our users to the right products for themselves at the lowest price.

We are starting with smartphones, laptops and other consumer electronics since there is an immediate and growing need for reliable recommendations for these products. We then plan to recommend other products such as cars and clothing, and then ultimately we’ll expand into other, more complicated decisions such as where to live or work. (Since you’re reading this, our non-ML based recommendation is that you really consider working here.)

Spammy search results, fake reviews, and paid affiliate sites make it nearly impossible to get an honest and relevant product recommendation. Finding the right item to meet your unique needs is tricky. Making the wrong choice based on bad information is a frustrating waste of time and money. We're solving the problem by combining actual human subject-area experts with machine learning to help everyone — regardless of their expertise — find their perfect product, quickly. To do that, we guide users through a series of questions about what they're looking for. After each answer, we share updated recommendations and encourage answering more questions to further improve our recommendations. We get more information about a user's specific needs from our quick and easy multiple-choice questions than e-commerce sites and search engines can deduce from search queries and past browsing data. Answers to our questions allow us to make better recommendations tailored to each user's unique needs.

A Small Team Where You Can Have A Big Impact

PerfectRec is a small, early-stage startup where you can have a big impact. Our founding team has experience building successful startups in the e-commerce and recommender systems space, as well as working at big organizations, like Google, Amazon, Microsoft and UC Berkeley. We are growing fast, and looking for people who are excited to build a new product where they can have a big impact. Our team is full of people passionate about the products we support, and recommending them.

Founder Led, Founder Funded

Our CEO Joe Golden bootstrapped his first startup, the custom photo products e-commerce site Collage.com, to ~$100m in revenue and a successful exit in March 2021. He’s using proceeds from that sale to build PerfectRec.

Working At PerfectRec

We are an all-remote company, so we don't care where you live as long as you work well in a fast-paced, collaborative remote environment.

PerfectRec is an Equal Opportunity Employer. We are committed to finding the best candidates for every role and giving them the tools and guidance they need to succeed. Our all-remote structure enables us to recruit anywhere in the world, so our talent pool isn't limited to a few big cities, and our asynchronous structure allows our team to work when it's best for them. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.

Learn more about how we work and our differentiating values.

What You’ll Do

On the ML team you will work on improving and expanding the core decision engine that powers the recommendations at PerfectRec. You will do this by identifying and analyzing problems as well as opportunities, exploring solutions and running experiments, and finally writing the code that puts your solution into practice and taking it live to users. Your work will directly impact and improve the user experience of anyone using the PerfectRec service and help countless users find the perfect products!

One of the areas you will work on is investigating and fixing bad predictions. When the model makes a not-so-perfect recommendation you will investigate deep into the model why this happened using analysis tools like Shapley values and others. You will identify what the likely cause is, this could be a data, feature or model issue among other things, and implement solutions that fix the problem. After running offline experiments to confirm your solution works you will roll out your improvements to production and see the recommendations improve on the live site.

Create and explore datasets for powering recommendations, working closely with domain experts.

Prototype models for making recommendations in new domains.

Use latest ML technologies such as Neural Networks, Transformers, XGBoost

Evaluate and compare different models, analyzing their tradeoffs in order to decide which model to use.

Add new capabilities that are shared between models in different categories.

Solve technical problems across the stack and contribute to all parts of our code base, including creation of our internal machine learning library.

Share your expertise and experience to grow with the team.

Collaborate with product, design, and engineers to understand customer needs, design solutions, and prototype, launch, and iterate.

Build a product that is genuinely loved by users and respects their time.

What You’ll Bring

Strong sense of ownership. Ownership is taking responsibility for the outcomes of a task or project. You’ll relish these ownership opportunities and ensure that tasks, projects, or the team are making positive forward progress.

Clear and concise communication. Building software is a team sport that relies heavily on great communication. You’ll be responsible for clear, thoughtful, and concise written and verbal communication. This includes the ability to give and receive feedback with empathy and understanding whether in a code review or a 1:1.

Willingness to learn and teach. We're always evolving with new tools and practices. You’ll be willing to jump in and learn unfamiliar technologies while also bringing others along with you. Mentorship and helping others learn are important parts of achieving this.

Creative problem solving. Creating a decision engine that can make recommendations across wide ranging domains is hard, and the potential approaches are limitless. You'll bring a research mindset and scientific rigor to evaluate and explore existing solutions, suggest new approaches, and be able to build models that successfully put them into practice.

Description

Description:

Until recently, returned datasets from planetary science missions beyond Earth orbit have been modest, due to the relatively small numbers of missions, and limitations in downlink bandwidth (e.g. NASA's Deep Space Network). Their sparsity has allowed for multiple generations of researchers to conduct data analysis by detailed inspection, calibration, cataloging and modeling of every byte of data. The future of planetary science bodes to be different, with increasing numbers of missions, instruments that produce vastly larger data rates and volumes, resulting in much larger amounts of data being recorded for analysis. As with Earth remote sensing, this changing exploration landscape requires a paradigm shift in how planetary science is conducted, and most especially making use of advanced computational tools to leverage the expertise of human researchers, and to make rapid analysis of very large datasets tractable. Recent advances in machine learning techniques have opened up a new frontier for tackling the 'big data' problem in planetary sciences. Successful applications so far include feature recognition and semantic segmentation of image data, feature extraction from time series data from plasma and field detection instruments, and real-time decision making on spacecraft such as Perseverance. Together with mentors at NASA GSFC, the researcher will apply machine learning techniques to image and spectroscopic data to produce new scientific results, and to devise new analysis methodologies. Results will be published in journals and presented at conferences.

Please contact the project mentor with any questions about project scope, background experience or eligibility.

Preferred Qualifications:

A post-doctoral researcher is sought with either pre-existing experience in machine learning applications in the geosciences or astronomy; or significant experience in computational techniques applied to scientific problems combined with a desire to quickly learn new techniques in machine learning. Strong computer coding skills are essential, and experience with python-based neural net architectures such as PyTorch, TensorFlow and Keras is preferable.

Description

The NASA Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, and ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission, slated for launch in 2022, will extend and improve NASA’s 20+ year record of satellite observations of global ocean biology, aerosols, and clouds. Designed and built at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), PACE will include the Ocean Color Instrument (OCI), an imaging spectrometer with sensitivity from the ultraviolet (UV) to near infrared (NIR), plus several discrete shortwave infrared bands. PACE will also have two contributed multi-angle polarimeters (MAPs), which maximize observed information about the earth’s atmosphere and ocean. Another upcoming mission is the Geostationary Littoral Imaging and Monitoring Radiometer (GLIMR), a NASA Earth Venture class hyperspectral imager devoted to coastal remote sensing from geostationary orbit.

Scientific data processing for these instruments will be performed in the NASA GSFC Ocean Ecology Laboratory (OEL), which has a long history of ocean color science data processing for instruments such as the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP). However, the hyperspectral, multi-angle, polarimetric and geostationary nature of the PACE and GLIMR missions means that the data volume will be significantly larger than in the past, and more sophisticated data analysis approaches will likely be needed in order to fully exploit these new datasets. In recognition of this challenge, NASA seeks a post-doctoral fellow with the appropriate data science skills to develop new methods of analysis, processing or otherwise.

Examples of areas of interest include:

deep learning for forward/inverse modeling
probabilistic programming
statistical analysis and inference methods
cloud computing
data reduction and mining methods
problem solving and algorithm design of complex systems using optimization methods

Candidates need not have a strong background in oceanography or atmospheric science to apply, although an interest in, and ability to understand the underlying problems is important. The role of the candidate is to seek new solutions to established problems in close collaboration with PACE domain specialists and implement them at scale. Candidates must have experience or training in one or more of the following skill sets as they apply to large datasets:

data science
computer science
statistics
artificial intelligence

A day in the life
Your day (or week) is a mix of meeting with product and service owners in GSS, sharing information and guidance, and doing hands-on modeling. In the morning, you meet with one of the product teams to understand their user stories and identify the right opportunities for AI/ML. After your meeting this morning about the experimental results, you have two more variations to try before a final decision can be made with the product team. Alternatively, you might pick up where you left off tuning your model for a different product that’s further along. Your accuracy and recall meet the thresholds the product team thinks customers will expect, but you think you can get a few percentage point improvement after talking with some data science colleagues in our Professional Services team last week. Before you close things down for the day, you do a quick check of your on-line messages to see if anything urgent arose while you were head-down on the ML work - but there’s nothing there that can’t wait until tomorrow.

Description

The 2010 Decadal Survey; New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics (National Research Council, 2010), prescribed the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) as its highest ranked large space project for the decade. WFIRST, conceived as a filled aperture, wide field, near infrared flagship-class observatory, was proposed to settle fundamental questions about the nature of dark energy and to complete the census of all possible types of exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy using wide-field imaging onto a very large, dense detector array. To accomplish this, the mission will accumulate 256 trillion pixel images at a rate of one every 15 minutes for analysis.

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), launched in early Spring of 2019, is conducting wide-field imaging of nearly the entire celestial sphere in search of exoplanets that eclipse their host star. Tiling the sky over a period of 2 years using four large detector arrays, TESS will recover about 2.5 million photometric lightcurves for each of its 26 sectors before moving on to a survey of the Galactic plane. The community, using a crude box-least squares method, is searching this vast trove for the faint signature of exoplanets - simply discarding other sources of stellar variability as noise.

These two missions and others under consideration have one thing in common – very large, very complex data sets replete with observatory systematics and elusive, tenuous astrophysical signals. Recognizing the significant challenge this raises for the science return of TESS, WFIRST and future survey missions, NASA seeks a post doctoral fellow with the necessary data science skills to formulate a systematic approach to extraction of science in the face of extremely high data rates or in large complex archives.

Examples of areas of interest include:

Machine learning for classification of astrophysical signals
Artificial intelligence augmentation of spaceborne observatories to reduce data transmission rates
Migration of science processing to cloud-based computing
Development of highly accessible data bases with in situ computing
Graphics Processing Unit acceleration of scientific data processing

Candidates need not have a strong background in astronomy or physics to apply. Candidates must have experience or training in one or more of the following skill sets in the service of, or scalable to very large data archives or high data accumulation rates:
