30 hours worked per week for 20 months: (30/40) x 20 months = 15 months full-time equivalent
20 hours worked per week for 12 months: (20/40) x 12 months = 6 months full-time equivalent

Experience for both required and desired qualifications can be gained through various combinations of formal professional employment, education, and volunteer experience. See below for how you may qualify.
