The EPA National Student Services Contract has an immediate opening for a part-time Data Scientist position with the Office of Research and Development at the EPA facility in Research Triangle Park, NC.

The Office of Research and Development at the EPA supports high-quality research to improve the scientific basis for decisions on national environmental issues and help EPA achieve its environmental goals. Research is conducted in a broad range of environmental areas by scientists in EPA laboratories and at universities across the country.

What the EPA project is about

The EPA Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE) is responsible for developing new computational tools and providing quantitative analysis for improving public health and environmental risk assessments and regulatory decisions pertaining to chemical safety. CCTE researchers integrate advances in biology, biotechnology, chemistry, and computer science to identify important biological processes that may be disrupted by the chemicals. The combined information helps prioritize chemicals based on potential human health risks. Using computational toxicology research, thousands of chemicals can be evaluated for potential risk at small cost in a very short amount of time.

EPA is responsible for ensuring the safety of thousands of chemicals but quantitative exposure data are available for only a small fraction of registered chemicals. As part of its ongoing efforts to support implementation of the Toxic Substance Act as revised by the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, EPA researchers are developing innovative methods to make exposure estimates for thousands of chemicals. These type of exposure data are combined with toxicity data to help thoroughly evaluate chemicals for potential health effects (https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/rapid-chemical-exposure-and-dose-research).

An SEI-er is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI-ers keenly understand how to adjust their support and problem solving based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, SEI-ers possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.

As super-connectors, they connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences. Mature, humble, and genuine, SEI-ers frequently go above and beyond for both their clients and their colleagues. SEI-ers are ethical and trustworthy individuals who consistently and repeatedly follow through, and hold true to their values in difficult situations. SEI-ers have an insatiable curiosity and love to learn. These individuals are commonly tech savvy and early adopters. Their passion for learning is infectious and excites others. As every project is different, an SEI-er must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. SEI-ers define ambition differently. They are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who truly enjoy one another- they like to hang out with colleagues outside of work, collaborate and hold one another accountable. SEI-ers enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends, and family.

How to Apply



Description

The EPA National Student Services Contract has an immediate opening for a part-time Data Scientist position with the Office of Research and Development at the EPA facility in Research Triangle Park, NC.

The Office of Research and Development at the EPA supports high-quality research to improve the scientific basis for decisions on national environmental issues and help EPA achieve its environmental goals. Research is conducted in a broad range of environmental areas by scientists in EPA laboratories and at universities across the country.

What the EPA project is about

The EPA Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE) is responsible for developing new computational tools and providing quantitative analysis for improving public health and environmental risk assessments and regulatory decisions pertaining to chemical safety. CCTE researchers integrate advances in biology, biotechnology, chemistry, and computer science to identify important biological processes that may be disrupted by the chemicals. The combined information helps prioritize chemicals based on potential human health risks. Using computational toxicology research, thousands of chemicals can be evaluated for potential risk at small cost in a very short amount of time.

EPA is responsible for ensuring the safety of thousands of chemicals but quantitative exposure data are available for only a small fraction of registered chemicals. As part of its ongoing efforts to support implementation of the Toxic Substance Act as revised by the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, EPA researchers are developing innovative methods to make exposure estimates for thousands of chemicals. These type of exposure data are combined with toxicity data to help thoroughly evaluate chemicals for potential health effects (https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/rapid-chemical-exposure-and-dose-research).

What experience and skills will you gain?

As a team member, you will provide data management, data curation and data analysis support for EPA’s HTTK and ExpoCast project. This project focuses on analyzing a database of in vitro toxicokinetic data, application of machine learning techniques (e.g., Random Forest) to generate predictive models, and the creation of R packages to package and distribute the R code and data for re-use by others. Toxicokinetics describes the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of chemicals by the body. Toxicokinetic information is needed to understand the risks posed by chemicals in the environment to the public health. The team member will be a member of a multi-disciplinary research team and support the development, maintenance, and analysis of EPA’s HTTK and ExpoCast projects.

Data Development and Analysis responsibilities will include:

Implementation of machine learning techniques using caret (R) or and/or Sci-Kit learn (Python);
Preparation and quality control of data and workflows;
Creation of metadata and fact sheets supporting the data products; and
Literature review.

The main area of work for the Systems team is training and inference for deep learning models (e.g., LLMs). We are currently heavily exploiting GPT-4, soon expect to be doing the same for Google’s LLM offering. These are powerful systems capable of delivering good language processing functionality across a wide range of tasks. However, they are slow and not necessarily as good on narrow tasks as small systems that have been specifically trained for the task. We need the capability to train (pre-train, fine tune) our own (small, fast) models, and deploy them for efficient inference. This includes (“distillation”) models that are trained on data generated from the more powerful LLMs.

You are a skilled, experienced Deep Learning Engineer to lead for this team. You must have significant hands-on experience on all aspects of developing, training, optimizing, and deploying deep learning models in production. You should have a sound grounding in machine learning fundamentals, and deep knowledge of the entire training and evaluation lifecycle – including acquiring and building out the large data sets needed for training. You should have a thorough background in existing deep learning stacks (Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, …). You should have hands-on knowledge of important developments in this fast-moving field – LORA, PEFT, quantization, optimization techniques used to get efficient inference performance. You should have a demonstrated track record of working with such models (eg in the context of open source LLMs such as Llama, MPT, Falcon, Mistral) and deploying them for production use. You should be an expert in the tools of the trade – Python, git, MLFlow tools such as WandB – know how to organize, run, evaluate a series of experiments for establishing basic theses for new LLM training. You should have demonstrated experience leading deep learning engineering teams and proven track record of mentoring young engineers in this space.

The Expertise and Skills You Bring

Master's in Machine Learning / Statistics or associated discipline + at least five years of industrial or research experience. PhD preferred.

Extremely strong systems skills necessary.
