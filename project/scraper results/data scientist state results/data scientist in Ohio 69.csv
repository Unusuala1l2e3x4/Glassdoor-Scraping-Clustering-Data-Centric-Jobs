EPA Office/Lab and Location: A research opportunity is currently available at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), Center for Environmental Solutions and Emergency Response (CESER) located in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Research Project: Millions of Lead Service Lines (LSLs) remain in place across the United States, posing a health risk to those who drink water that is distributed from municipal water systems through LSLs and into homes. The Center for Environmental and Emergency Response is conducting applied research to evaluate technologies that help communities identify where LSLs are located, and data is being collected to determine their cost-effectiveness, accuracy and ease of use. Information about this research will be provided to states, communities, and tribal nations to help them rapidly identify LSLs and remove them. This research is particularly focused on providing the science data and information that small, disadvantaged, or undeserved communities may need to remove these sources of lead.

Under the guidance of a mentor, research activities may include:

Obtaining knowledge and experience with science data management tools, data analysis methods, statistical analyses, data user interfacing, and other data management tools.
Generating manuscripts, presentations and other outputs related to drinking water research projects including lead service line identification projects through collaboration on informational resources in support of clear technical communications and project management.
Creating science data display designs such as info-graphics, data output graphics, and other data outputs for the purpose of developing technical project presentations (e.g., posters and slide shows).
Gaining knowledge of the science behind drinking water treatment and chemistry.
Contributing to developing presentations and technical manuscripts.

Learning Objectives: The research participant will learn to display data by collecting and processing the pertinent historical data applying appropriate analytical techniques. The research participant will learn to manage data sets through various technologies and systems, as well as corresponding statistical tools. The research participant will collaborate with community members and other researchers to understand the systems and support needs captured through participatory research. An important part of this research project is disseminating results and findings. The research participant will be provided an opportunity to disseminate production of outputs related to drinking water research. This will include lead service line identification projects through collaboration on informational resources in support of clear technical communications and project management. The research participant will learn basic science behind drinking water treatment and chemistry.

Mentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is Darren Lytle (lytle.darren@epa.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research please contact the mentor.
