Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

Our Client

We are a venture-backed startup building the infrastructure layer for Property & Casualty (P&C) insurance. Integrating technology in the insurance industry today is much like consumer finance pre-Plaid (we could succinctly be described as ""Plaid for Insurance""), or payments pre-Stripe, and our vision is to unlock a similar wave of innovation for the $2T global P&C industry.

Today, walking into an insurance agency is like stepping into a time machine. Filing cabinets, fax machines, piles of incoming and outgoing mail. What you don't see is that even for the parts that have been ""digitized"", needless manual work abounds. Few systems communicate directly, leading to endless copy-pasting from emails to various proprietary web portals/desktop apps and back again.

Carrier by carrier, endpoint by endpoint, we will bring each of those manual and error-prone workflows into our simple, modern API layer.

The implementation details are subject to change, but this is our north star, and the future we envision isn't possible without it.

What we're looking for

We are seeking a highly autonomous engineer (employee #2!) excited about owning the design and implementation of a robust, API-driven product and playing a foundational role in the formation of the company.

Responsibilities
You'll work closely with the team and early customers to build a world-class, API-driven product.
You'll solve hard technical problems from scratch, owning the solution through the entire development lifecycle.
You'll help define the tech stack/architecture for a fledgling product — we're technology agnostic and focus using the right tool for the job.
You'll contribute to the creation of the team culture, as well as internal tooling and processes.
Role requirements
4+ years professional backend/full-stack engineering experience. Working on large-scale open-source projects works too. You've played significant roles in either API design, building processing pipelines, or systemic integration of external systems.
Early-stage startup experience (or other similar unstructured, fast-paced environment)
Live in or willing to relocate to the Bay Area to work full-time in our SF office
Nice to haves
Experience with web scraping, email scraping, RPA — in general just getting data creatively out of hard-to-reach places
1+ years TypeScript/JavaScript experience in a professional or large-scale OSS setting. If you have a comprehensive side project you think is equivalent, send it our way! Clear, concise, and extensible code is important to us and collaborating with others is often a forcing function to that end.
Experience integrating with low tech industries, or other time spent integrating with poorly documented, antiquated APIs (and sometimes even a lack thereof)
Why you should join us
Opportunity to be a foundational team member to a well-funded, post-product and -revenue startup in a massive and largely untapped industry.
Hard backend engineering problems on day 1. Backend is all we do, and the projects you'll work on will be challenging and interesting.
Generous equity comp (90th+ percentile) and competitive cash comp (50th percentile). As we're a startup, we're happy to play with the balance for exceptional candidates.
The Founding Team

Our CEO is a strong engineer in his own right (Waterloo grad, senior eng at multiple Bay Area startups) but will be focusing on the business/product side. He’s gone super deep on insurance, including getting a Broker License and a stint as an Insurtech EIR at a top VC firm.

We’ve raised funding from great investors including top seed funds, ex-Plaid folks, and insurance industry insiders.

Salary Range: $160,000-$180,000 base.

"Vice President, Data Science- Systems Engineering (HYBRID)","Inclusively
","Smithfield, RI",$77K - $127K (Glassdoor est.),5.0,"Inclusively is partnering with a multinational financial services company to hire a Vice President, Data Science- Systems Engineering (HYBRID).

ABOUT INCLUSIVELY:

Inclusively is a digital tech platform that connects candidates with disabilities, who may benefit from workplace accommodations, to inclusive employers. This includes all disabilities under the ADA, including mental health conditions (e.g. anxiety, depression, PTSD), chronic illnesses (e.g. diabetes, Long COVID), and neurodivergence (e.g. autism, ADHD). Applicants with one or more of these conditions are encouraged to apply; Inclusively does not require applicants to disclose their specific disability.

The Role

The main area of work for the Systems team is training and inference for deep learning models (e.g., LLMs). We are currently heavily exploiting GPT-4, soon expect to be doing the same for Google’s LLM offering. These are powerful systems capable of delivering good language processing functionality across a wide range of tasks. However, they are slow and not necessarily as good on narrow tasks as small systems that have been specifically trained for the task. We need the capability to train (pre-train, fine tune) our own (small, fast) models, and deploy them for efficient inference. This includes (“distillation”) models that are trained on data generated from the more powerful LLMs.

You are a skilled, experienced Deep Learning Engineer to lead for this team. You must have significant hands-on experience on all aspects of developing, training, optimizing, and deploying deep learning models in production. You should have a sound grounding in machine learning fundamentals, and deep knowledge of the entire training and evaluation lifecycle – including acquiring and building out the large data sets needed for training. You should have a thorough background in existing deep learning stacks (Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, …). You should have hands-on knowledge of important developments in this fast-moving field – LORA, PEFT, quantization, optimization techniques used to get efficient inference performance. You should have a demonstrated track record of working with such models (eg in the context of open source LLMs such as Llama, MPT, Falcon, Mistral) and deploying them for production use. You should be an expert in the tools of the trade – Python, git, MLFlow tools such as WandB – know how to organize, run, evaluate a series of experiments for establishing basic theses for new LLM training. You should have demonstrated experience leading deep learning engineering teams and proven track record of mentoring young engineers in this space.

The Expertise and Skills You Bring

Master's in Machine Learning / Statistics or associated discipline + at least five years of industrial or research experience. PhD preferred.

Extremely strong systems skills necessary.

The Team

At the Asset Management Artificial Intelligence Center of Excellence (AM AI-COE), we are bringing in groundbreaking AI technologies to the Company’s Asset Management. Our team consists of a diverse group of hard-working Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers who collaborate with business collaborators to develop AI/ML solutions to complex challenges in Asset Management. We are passionate about Large Language Models (LLMs) and are building the platform and capability to enable their applications in Asset Management.
