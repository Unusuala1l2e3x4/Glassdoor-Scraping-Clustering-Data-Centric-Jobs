Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute is proud to be Florida’s only National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center located in Tampa. We strive to be the leader in understanding the complexity of cancer through team science and applying those insights for human benefits. Every Team Member of Moffitt focuses on our lasting commitment to our mission: To contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer.




Position Highlights:

The Data Scientist III (DS) will work directly with key stakeholders throughout Moffitt to document data-related needs and identify novel approaches, including advanced data science and analytics techniques, for addressing those needs. The DS will incorporate these novel approaches into the larger Health Data Services and Digital Innovation strategies. The DS will liaise directly with both clinical and research faculty whose work is focused on genomics, radiomics, immuno-oncology, evolutionary therapy, patient-reported outcomes, and other areas to ensure Moffitt’s analytics methods are best positioned to accelerate discovery using Moffitt’s vast data assets.

Optimizing the use of Moffitt’s data assets requires careful considerations of data formatting, lineage, quality, linkages, and visualizations. As Moffitt continues to incorporate new data types into its cloud-based analytics platform, modern strategies for data provenance, ingestion, linkage, and dissemination will become even more critical for the ultimate realization of the value of these data across the Center. Innovative data types include, but are not limited to, medical record text, radiology and pathology images, molecular data, and patient-generated data (wearables).

Our team thrives on collaboration and sharing ideas, whether in a cross-functional meeting or at one of our virtual team-building events.

While we're diverse in our backgrounds and skills, we have much in common. A passion for our mission. A strong sense of integrity. A belief that we're making a positive impact and a commitment to having fun.

We are seeking a Principal Data Scientist to join our team to join our team for this hybrid opportunity working out of our Waltham, MA; Austin, TX; or St. Petersburg, FL offices. We are also extending this as a remote opportunity to candidates located in the Chicago, IL metropolitan area.

Job Summary

The Data Science team is responsible for building out the machine learning capabilities of Imprivata’s Digital Identity Platform, with specific projects ranging from detecting patient privacy violations to using machine learning to empower what would be otherwise manual workflows. As a Principal Data Scientist, you’ll be deeply involved in every aspect of the project lifecycle, including gathering requirements, cleaning and exploring datasets, running machine learning experiments, and deploying services to production.

Duties and Responsibilities

Put ethics and security first. The datasets that we use almost invariably contain PHI or similarly sensitive information, and we take the responsibility that comes with that access seriously.
Drive business value with machine learning. That includes everything from initial framing of the problem, to pulling and working with data, to training models, to communicating results.
Write high quality, production Python code. While we work closely with other engineering teams, we don’t hand off research code to be productionized by someone else – we own our solutions end-to-end and do our best to keep raising the technical bar.
Build a breadth of machine learning knowledge. Beyond actually training models, you’ll rely on that fluency when it comes to tasks like gathering requirements or iterating on model output with subject matter experts.
Communicate effectively. Taking your project from business problem to production service isn’t a solo exercise; you’ll need to work well with people from other teams and our own in order to succeed.
Improve the team. Everyone is responsible for making the team better: as a Principal Data Scientist, you’ll have an informal mentorship role by way of things like pair programming and providing meaningful code reviews.

Qualifications

Excellent problem solving skills.
Solid experience with Python and common Data Science packages, such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn. Additional experience with relevant packages such as PyTorch, Dask, Pydantic a plus.
Strong understanding of standard machine learning techniques such as classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction.
Deep expertise in one or more areas of machine learning, such as deep learning, natural language processing, graph methods, etc.
Proficiency with SQL and relational databases.
Experience working in a Unix environment.
5-7 years of data science experience and bachelors degree in computer science, machine learning or similar.

This position offers a salary range of $150,800.00 to $187,800.00 (inclusive of variable compensation such as bonuses and incentives). In addition, more information about Imprivata’s benefit offerings can be found here. This salary range represents the high and low end of Imprivata’s salary range for this position. Actual salaries will vary and may be above or below the range based on various factors, such as a candidate’s location, skills, experience, and qualifications.

At Imprivata, we have a top-notch work environment, developmental opportunities, a competitive total rewards package, and the desire to have fun. If you have the skills and qualifications as we have described above, we want to hear from you!
