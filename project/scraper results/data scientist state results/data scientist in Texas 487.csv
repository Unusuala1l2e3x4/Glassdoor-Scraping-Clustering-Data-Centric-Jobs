AI Strategist,"KUNGFU.AI
","Austin, TX",-1,4.9,"KUNGFU.AI is a management consulting and engineering firm focused exclusively on artificial intelligence. We empower CEOs and senior executives to leverage the full potential of AI so they remain competitive in a rapidly evolving world.

Our expert team delivers AI strategy and bespoke production-grade solutions that allow clients to rapidly realize value. We stand apart because we implement our AI strategies into production quickly, safely, and responsibly.

Outside of our virtual walls we are painters, foodies, cocktail connoisseurs, musicians, crossword-doers, athletes, dungeon masters, non-profit board members, and more. We’d welcome the opportunity to meet you.

At KFAI, Strategy is about helping our clients to navigate the unique and unprecedented challenges associated with integrating AI/ML approaches into their organizations, and ultimately to identify and leverage AI/ML capabilities as a sustainable differentiator or competitive advantage.

As a Strategist at KFAI, you will be part of a uniquely business-value driven approach to helping our clients accelerate and de-risk their efforts to advance their AI capabilities and use cases. Your primary toolset will be creative quantitative and competitive analysis of clients’ AI imperative executed alongside direct observation, discovery and assessment of clients’ relevant organizational capabilities.
Here's what you'll deliver to our clients:
Tight articulation and quantifiable specification of the challenges and/or opportunities they hope to address through the application of AI/ML
Insider-level understanding of the nature of their business - from operational realities to legacy product roadmaps - acquired quickly and arrayed against a necessary grasp of the clients’ external strategic landscape
Fresh insights into the organizational, leadership, cultural, structural, and process realities that define the context in which our solutions must succeed
Evaluation of a client’s organizational assets - current and potential - based on a deep understanding of their full data assets and ecosystem (internal and external) as well as their core and differentiating core competencies
Tightly specified and actionable recommendations - implicating all of the above - that promise to advance their successful application of AI/ML, including assessments of feasibility and potential impact and options for roadmapping activities several years into the future
What we're looking for:
Someone who can independently conduct SME interviews across a wide diversity of backgrounds and functions, quickly isolating core stakeholder, organizational and engagement dynamics that could affect the validity and/or feasibility of our recommendations
Someone who can confidently and credibly hold a mirror up to a client, showing them things they are often not aware of and may be reluctant to admit
Someone who can apply a product management and/or design thinking mindset to organizing client recommendations and roadmaps
Someone who can collaborate seamlessly with some of the brightest engineers on the planet on engagements that require strategic alignment of engineering activities to ensure maximal client impact
A people person. Someone whose emotional intelligence and ability to communicate to a wide range of audiences (C-suite to IC, technical and non-technical) in a wide range of scenarios is a proven strength
Strong skills in business quantitative analysis including how business data is operationally originated and curated, used to generate financial reporting, capable of telling ‘stories’ about how organizations function, applied to compelling business cases supporting corporate valuation
An interest in working collaboratively with data scientists on the Strategy Team to conduct exploratory data analysis and formulate and test specific hypotheses
A basic fluency in data as it is applied in AI modeling. You have some understanding of different data types, what data governance is and why it’s important, what a machine learning model is and how it’s trained, etc. An interest in ethical AI is a must, but you don’t need to have experience in it
An appreciation of autonomy, research, people, and technology. This role is very interdisciplinary
Someone who probably has an advanced degree in a human-centric discipline (Business, Social Anthropology, Psychology, etc.), but it’s not a dealbreaker if you don’t
What's in it for you?

This is a full-time or contract-based position that is remote. For full-time team members, compensation includes competitive salary, company stock grant, top (‘gold’) level of health, dental and vision insurance (KUNGFU.AI covers 100% of your premiums and 50% for any dependents), health and dependent flexible spending accounts, short- and long-term disability insurance, unlimited vacation (that you're encouraged to take), paid parental leave, and more.



If this opportunity excites you, we can’t wait to meet you!

An SEI-er is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI-ers keenly understand how to adjust their support and problem solving based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, SEI-ers possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.

They are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who truly enjoy one another- they like to hang out with colleagues outside of work, collaborate and hold one another accountable. SEI-ers enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends, and family.

An SEI-er is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI-ers keenly understand how to adjust their support and problem solving based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, SEI-ers possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.

Description
Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis.

ARS Office/Lab and Location: A research opportunity is currently available within the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), located in College Station, Texas.

The USDA ARS mission involves problem-solving research in the widely diverse food and agricultural areas encompassing plant production and protection; animal production and protection; natural resources and sustainable agricultural systems; and nutrition; food safety; and quality. The programs are conducted in 46 of the 50 States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. For ARS to maintain its standing as a premier scientific organization, major investments in computing, networking, and storage infrastructure are required. Training in data and information management are integral to the integrity, security, and accessibility of research findings, results, and outcomes within the ARS research enterprise. Nearly 2000 scientists and postdoctoral fellows conduct research within the ARS research enterprise.

Research Project: The SCINet/Big Data Research Participation Program of the USDA ARS offers research opportunities to motivated postdoctoral fellows interested in solving agriculture-related problems at a range of spatial and temporal scales, from the genome to the continent, and sub-daily to evolutionary time scales. One of the goals of the SCINet Initiative is to develop and apply new technologies, including AI and machine learning, to help solve complex agricultural problems that also depend on collaboration across scientific disciplines and geographic locations. In addition, many of these technologies rely on the synthesis, integration, and analysis of large, diverse datasets that benefit from high performance computing (HPC) clusters. The objective of this fellowship is to facilitate cross-disciplinary, cross-location research through collaborative research on problems of interest to each applicant and amenable to or requiring the HPC environment. Training will be provided in data science, scientific computing, AI/machine learning, and related topics as needed for the fellow to complete their research.

The selected fellow will be part of an interdisciplinary pest weevil team with interests in weevil pest management, genomics, diagnostic tools, and functional testing. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop pipelines that incorporate machine learning algorithms to improve analyses in many systems including those involving large scale comparisons, descriptive analyses, and identification of informative genetic regions for diagnostic and biological experimentation. The fellow will mine existing high quality reference genomes and extensive whole genome population sequence data to identify gene regions and/or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are unique to pest weevils and subsequently, can be used to accurately distinguish pest from non-pest weevil species. The fellow will then focus on the development, training, and testing of machine learning algorithms which can be incorporated into a molecular-based diagnostic tool to accurately distinguish pest weevils from non-pest weevils. Incorporation of these data into a supervised, discriminatory training algorithm will greatly enhance our ability to identify the most informative genetic features of a pest weevil which, in turn, can be used in a molecular-based tool to differentiate the pest weevil from other weevil species.

Learning Objectives: The fellow will learn about a wide range of activities related to weevil biology, genomes, and bioinformatics, through collaboration with a multi-disciplinary research team. The candidate will have opportunities to be involved at all levels of experimentation including hands-on laboratory work, data analysis and management, tool development, and authoring resulting manuscripts. The fellow will be encouraged to engage in machine learning working groups, meetings, and training. The fellow will also have the opportunity to present results at National and International meetings as well as ARS webinars and publish peer-reviewed publications.

Mentor(s): The mentors(s) for this opportunity is Lindsey Perkin (Lindsey.perkin@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: 2023; start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: Appointment length will initially be for two years but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full-time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The current stipend range for this opportunity is $85,000 - $95,000/year plus a supplement to offset a health insurance premium.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR), and foreign nationals. Non-U.S. citizen applicants should refer to the Guidelines for Non-U.S. Citizens Details page of the program website for information about the valid immigration statuses that are acceptable for program participation.

ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS. Participants do not become employees of USDA, ARS, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.

The successful applicant(s) will be required to comply with Environmental, Safety and Health (ES&H) requirements of the hosting facility, including but not limited to, COVID-19 requirements (e.g., facial covering, physical distancing, testing, vaccination).

Questions: Please visit our Program Website. After reading, if you have additional questions about the application process, please email ORISE.ARS.SCINet@orau.org and include the reference code for this opportunity.

CV and Image Data Analysts are responsible for assembling image data sets for testing models and methods, finding available models which are appropriate for the image processing needs of a specific project, setting up computational environments, processing images and extracting information and understanding from them, and building and testing models. Due to the exploratory and interdisciplinary nature of our projects, duties associated with CV often overlap and intersect with those from other disciplines, such as data analytics and synthesis, ML, and software/algorithm development. Thus, familiarity with disciplines outside of CV are valuable and domain expertise in other fields provides a novel context for application of CV methods.

For some of our more nascent projects, pre-existing data sets are not always available, so there is also a strong data acquisition (DAQ) and data synthesis aspect to our work. To that end, some projects involve working with hardware and sensors, most notably cameras. Projects may require operating DAQ systems and going out and collecting field or lab data. Other projects have virtual environments set up in which 3D models and simulations are used for creating training data using rendering engines, physics-based modeling software, and finite element analysis tools.

Even though you will start off focusing on one specific domain, team members are frequently involved on multiple projects with duties that span across these core disciplines. It is perfectly acceptable if find yourself slowly branching out or changing disciplines as your interests change and certain projects gain more traction than others. Branching out takes the form of joining existing projects or working on proposals to start new ones. Each of us is involved to some degree with the evaluation of government-released research solicitations. When batches of solicitations are released by various government entities, like NASA or the Department of Defense, for example, we come together as a team and decide on which ones we should pursue and who will lead efforts on writing proposals to the selected topics.


Interview Process

After applicants have submitted their application, our interviews follow a four-step process:

Pre-screening and request for work sample. If an applicant's resume passes pre-screening, Lynntech will send out a candidate packet which contains information about the company and the team. We will also request a work sample which is demonstrative of the applicant's experience relevant to the job posting. If the work sample demonstrates relevant proficiency in the job domain, Lynntech will continue with scheduling a time for an interview.
1st Interview (Usually Phone/Virtual unless local candidate). [Duration: 1 hr] During this call, both parties will review background information and review eligibility requirements. Company policies, job expectations, work environment, and availability will be discussed. The interview may conclude here if the candidate is no longer interested in pursuing the opportunity or if the candidate does not meet basic eligibility requirements. We will also discuss the different roles in the group and establish the domain specific project needs which we have at that moment and candidate will be asked to rank their experience and comfort level with the various core disciplines. Candidates will be expected to elaborate on their relevant past project experience.
Candidate Assessment, Part 1: If both parties choose to continue, candidates will be asked to complete and submit Part 1 of the Assessment which was included in their packets. This assessment covers fundamentals in computer literacy, programming, and mathematics. Lynntech will review the submission and before scheduling a second interview. Part 2 of the assessment is only requested if a second interview is scheduled.
2nd Interview (Usually On-site*) and Part 2 of Assessment. [Duration: 3 to 4 hr] If both parties choose to continue, an in-person interview will be scheduled, and the candidate is responsible for completing Part 2 of the assessment prior to the second interview. The candidate will be notified in advance if an optional domain specific assignment or live coding interview is required. This final step will be comprised of the following:
Past Project Presentation/Demo: The candidate will give a 10-15 minute presentation/demonstration of a past personal or professional project which relates to one of our core disciplines. Your presentation should resemble more of a story than an academic talk and it can be an example from your past personal or professional experience. If you have physical or virtual demonstrations at hand, or something interactive, you're encouraged to bring them. It's also beneficial if you have pictures/graphics and videos walking us through your development process and showing the final result. Highlight any problems or challenges you faced along the way and how you overcame them. There will be time at the end for Q&A and open discussion. If you're uncertain about what topic to present on, please reference our technical domains for guidance. Duration: 25 to 45 min
Project Domains and Core Disciplines Discussion: We will discuss what the existing project needs are and how the candidate's skill set can best fit the project needs. We will review the various roles, responsibilities, and how the various core disciplines relate to our projects. Duration: 30 to 40 min
[Optional] Assessment Review: If reviewers have previously provided a domain specific assignment, candidate answers will be reviewed, and additional questions may be given. Interviewers will assess candidate's ability to reason through challenges and their ability to identify and test their assumptions when approaching problems. Duration: 30 to 60 min
[Optional] Live Coding Interview: A live open-book set of coding problems. Candidates will be given programming problems which they must solve. Internet search will be available for looking up information and interviewers will be there to answer questions and help if necessary. This will test not only the candidate's ability to program, but also their ability to search for answers and ask for help and collaborate when appropriate. Duration: 30 to 60 min
For long-distance candidates, this may be a virtual interview. If a job offer is made the candidate will be invited to for an on-site visit before a final response is expected.

Our Client

We are a venture-backed startup building the infrastructure layer for Property & Casualty (P&C) insurance. Integrating technology in the insurance industry today is much like consumer finance pre-Plaid (we could succinctly be described as ""Plaid for Insurance""), or payments pre-Stripe, and our vision is to unlock a similar wave of innovation for the $2T global P&C industry.

Today, walking into an insurance agency is like stepping into a time machine. Filing cabinets, fax machines, piles of incoming and outgoing mail. What you don't see is that even for the parts that have been ""digitized"", needless manual work abounds. Few systems communicate directly, leading to endless copy-pasting from emails to various proprietary web portals/desktop apps and back again.

Carrier by carrier, endpoint by endpoint, we will bring each of those manual and error-prone workflows into our simple, modern API layer.

The implementation details are subject to change, but this is our north star, and the future we envision isn't possible without it.

What we're looking for

We are seeking a highly autonomous engineer (employee #2!) excited about owning the design and implementation of a robust, API-driven product and playing a foundational role in the formation of the company.

Responsibilities
You'll work closely with the team and early customers to build a world-class, API-driven product.
You'll solve hard technical problems from scratch, owning the solution through the entire development lifecycle.
You'll help define the tech stack/architecture for a fledgling product — we're technology agnostic and focus using the right tool for the job.
You'll contribute to the creation of the team culture, as well as internal tooling and processes.
Role requirements
4+ years professional backend/full-stack engineering experience. Working on large-scale open-source projects works too. You've played significant roles in either API design, building processing pipelines, or systemic integration of external systems.
Early-stage startup experience (or other similar unstructured, fast-paced environment)
Live in or willing to relocate to the Bay Area to work full-time in our SF office
Nice to haves
Experience with web scraping, email scraping, RPA — in general just getting data creatively out of hard-to-reach places
1+ years TypeScript/JavaScript experience in a professional or large-scale OSS setting. If you have a comprehensive side project you think is equivalent, send it our way! Clear, concise, and extensible code is important to us and collaborating with others is often a forcing function to that end.
Experience integrating with low tech industries, or other time spent integrating with poorly documented, antiquated APIs (and sometimes even a lack thereof)

Starting in rural America. Today, 60 million Americans living in rural communities are facing a crisis of access to care. In the U.S. healthcare system, rural Americans experience significantly poorer clinical outcomes. This trend is rapidly accelerating as rural hospitals close and physician shortages increase, exacerbating health disparities. In fact, Americans living in rural communities suffer a mortality rate 23 percent higher than those in urban communities, in part because of the lack of access to quality care.

Our vision is care that enables everyone to achieve their best health. So, we're rearchitecting the way it's delivered – leveraging breakthroughs in diagnostics, remote monitoring, and a variety of other domains, Homeward is creating a new healthcare delivery model that is purpose-built for rural America and directly addresses the issues that have historically limited access and quality.

Most importantly, we're aligning everyone's incentives (ours, partner health plans', and members') towards getting and keeping people healthy by taking full responsibility and financial risk for the total cost of each member's healthcare and outcomes.

Homeward is co-founded by a leadership team that defined and delivered Livongo's products, and backed most recently by a $50 million series B co-led by Arch Ventures and Human Capital, with participation from General Catalyst for a total of $70 million in funding.

What You'll Do

Identify needs and deliver analytic products – from formal business intelligence products to ad-hoc analytics
Develop, mature, and deliver our business intelligence strategy across the enterprise, across growth, clinical delivery, quality, and cost results for internal and external audiences

Develop systems and processes to use our data effectively, accurately, and efficiently across the enterprise
Collaborate with our Technology team to deliver requirements on the highest priority data sources and most appropriate structures for analytics

What You Bring

3+ years of experience in data analysis and/or business intelligence development
Demonstrated orientation toward ensuring data quality and accuracy on a case-by-case basis and at scale

Collaborative spirit and ability to drive analyses with technical and non-technical stakeholders
Ability to zoom in with attention to detail and also zoom out to see the big picture
Strong communicator of questions, challenges, opportunities, and results to technical and non-technical audiences




Bonus Points

Experience with EHR and claims data, as well as value-based care analytics
Experience with marketing measurement, attribution, forecasting, and experimental test design and evaluation
