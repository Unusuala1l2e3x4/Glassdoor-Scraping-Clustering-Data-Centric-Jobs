Our team thrives on collaboration and sharing ideas, whether in a cross-functional meeting or at one of our virtual team-building events.

While we're diverse in our backgrounds and skills, we have much in common. A passion for our mission. A strong sense of integrity. A belief that we're making a positive impact and a commitment to having fun.

We are seeking a Principal Data Scientist to join our team to join our team for this hybrid opportunity working out of our Waltham, MA; Austin, TX; or St. Petersburg, FL offices. We are also extending this as a remote opportunity to candidates located in the Chicago, IL metropolitan area.

Job Summary

The Data Science team is responsible for building out the machine learning capabilities of Imprivata’s Digital Identity Platform, with specific projects ranging from detecting patient privacy violations to using machine learning to empower what would be otherwise manual workflows. As a Principal Data Scientist, you’ll be deeply involved in every aspect of the project lifecycle, including gathering requirements, cleaning and exploring datasets, running machine learning experiments, and deploying services to production.

Duties and Responsibilities

Put ethics and security first. The datasets that we use almost invariably contain PHI or similarly sensitive information, and we take the responsibility that comes with that access seriously.
Drive business value with machine learning. That includes everything from initial framing of the problem, to pulling and working with data, to training models, to communicating results.
Write high quality, production Python code. While we work closely with other engineering teams, we don’t hand off research code to be productionized by someone else – we own our solutions end-to-end and do our best to keep raising the technical bar.
Build a breadth of machine learning knowledge. Beyond actually training models, you’ll rely on that fluency when it comes to tasks like gathering requirements or iterating on model output with subject matter experts.
Communicate effectively. Taking your project from business problem to production service isn’t a solo exercise; you’ll need to work well with people from other teams and our own in order to succeed.
Improve the team. Everyone is responsible for making the team better: as a Principal Data Scientist, you’ll have an informal mentorship role by way of things like pair programming and providing meaningful code reviews.

Qualifications

Excellent problem solving skills.
Solid experience with Python and common Data Science packages, such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn. Additional experience with relevant packages such as PyTorch, Dask, Pydantic a plus.
Strong understanding of standard machine learning techniques such as classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction.
Deep expertise in one or more areas of machine learning, such as deep learning, natural language processing, graph methods, etc.
Proficiency with SQL and relational databases.
Experience working in a Unix environment.
5-7 years of data science experience and bachelors degree in computer science, machine learning or similar.

This position offers a salary range of $150,800.00 to $187,800.00 (inclusive of variable compensation such as bonuses and incentives). In addition, more information about Imprivata’s benefit offerings can be found here. This salary range represents the high and low end of Imprivata’s salary range for this position.

Our data scientists have access to the data that tells the story of some of the supply chain disruptions that have been making the news over the last few years (COVID-19, Suez Canal blockage, increases in extreme weather, etc.). We can see that in our data and provide real-time solutions for our customers.

What Data Scientists Do Here

At the end of the day, project44 is a data company. Project44 has grown to a $1B+ valuation by making supply chain and logistics datasets available and visible to the people who need them. The next step is to extract insights from that data – and that’s where we come in. While some companies have data scientists whose primary focus is on making the organization smarter, our focus is on providing insights to our customers. We use all sorts of data (geospatial, time-series, etc…) to build models that predict the route that a shipment might take, estimate the time a truck/train/ship might arrive at its destination, and ultimately model the behavior of every “link” in the global supply “chain”. Our Data Scientists collaborate with engineers, product owners, and most importantly one another to contribute insights and data science best practices to all parts of the business.

We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.
https://www.recruitingfromscratch.com/
Our Client

We are a venture-backed startup building the infrastructure layer for Property & Casualty (P&C) insurance. Integrating technology in the insurance industry today is much like consumer finance pre-Plaid (we could succinctly be described as ""Plaid for Insurance""), or payments pre-Stripe, and our vision is to unlock a similar wave of innovation for the $2T global P&C industry.

Today, walking into an insurance agency is like stepping into a time machine. Filing cabinets, fax machines, piles of incoming and outgoing mail. What you don't see is that even for the parts that have been ""digitized"", needless manual work abounds. Few systems communicate directly, leading to endless copy-pasting from emails to various proprietary web portals/desktop apps and back again.

Carrier by carrier, endpoint by endpoint, we will bring each of those manual and error-prone workflows into our simple, modern API layer.

The implementation details are subject to change, but this is our north star, and the future we envision isn't possible without it.

What we're looking for

We are seeking a highly autonomous engineer (employee #2!) excited about owning the design and implementation of a robust, API-driven product and playing a foundational role in the formation of the company.

Responsibilities
You'll work closely with the team and early customers to build a world-class, API-driven product.
You'll solve hard technical problems from scratch, owning the solution through the entire development lifecycle.
You'll help define the tech stack/architecture for a fledgling product — we're technology agnostic and focus using the right tool for the job.
You'll contribute to the creation of the team culture, as well as internal tooling and processes.
Role requirements
4+ years professional backend/full-stack engineering experience. Working on large-scale open-source projects works too. You've played significant roles in either API design, building processing pipelines, or systemic integration of external systems.
Early-stage startup experience (or other similar unstructured, fast-paced environment)
Live in or willing to relocate to the Bay Area to work full-time in our SF office
Nice to haves
Experience with web scraping, email scraping, RPA — in general just getting data creatively out of hard-to-reach places
1+ years TypeScript/JavaScript experience in a professional or large-scale OSS setting. If you have a comprehensive side project you think is equivalent, send it our way! Clear, concise, and extensible code is important to us and collaborating with others is often a forcing function to that end.
Experience integrating with low tech industries, or other time spent integrating with poorly documented, antiquated APIs (and sometimes even a lack thereof)
Why you should join us
Opportunity to be a foundational team member to a well-funded, post-product and -revenue startup in a massive and largely untapped industry.
Hard backend engineering problems on day 1. Backend is all we do, and the projects you'll work on will be challenging and interesting.
Generous equity comp (90th+ percentile) and competitive cash comp (50th percentile). As we're a startup, we're happy to play with the balance for exceptional candidates.
The Founding Team

Our CEO is a strong engineer in his own right (Waterloo grad, senior eng at multiple Bay Area startups) but will be focusing on the business/product side. He’s gone super deep on insurance, including getting a Broker License and a stint as an Insurtech EIR at a top VC firm.

We’ve raised funding from great investors including top seed funds, ex-Plaid folks, and insurance industry insiders.

Salary Range: $160,000-$180,000 base.
