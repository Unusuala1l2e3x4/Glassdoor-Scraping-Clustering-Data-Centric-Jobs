In this project, we seek to integrate social determinants of health into an AI/ML-based predictive model of a composite outcome that measures disparities in care to enable more precise risk stratification among patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma compared to existing models. The proposed work is a key step toward this goal because it will enable us to accurately identify patients at the highest risk of suboptimal treatment so that we can employ interventions that promote healthcare equity. Our long-term goal, is to reduce health disparities and improve outcomes in multiple myeloma care through targeted interventions for at-risk individuals.

Guillermo (Gary) J. Tearney, M.D., Ph.D.
Tearney Lab – Wellman Center for Photomedicine
Massachusetts General Hospital

The Tearney Lab is an 80+ person multidisciplinary lab led by Guillermo (Gary) Tearney, MD, PhD. The goal of the Tearney Lab is to see every cell in the human body so that disease can be detected at its earliest stages when it can be cured.

To this end, the lab has pioneered multiple optical coherence tomography (OCT) devices that enable 3D imaging at the microscopic scale in living human patients. These technologies include multimodality OCT where OCT is combined with spectroscopy, fluorescence, and other optical techniques, ultrahigh-resolution OCT (µOCT) where the resolution is sufficiently detailed to visualize individual cells, and functional OCT that measures the function and metabolism of cells in living systems. These technologies are implemented in a variety of devices (endoscopes, catheters, capsules, implantable) that provide accessible imaging anywhere inside the body. The lab has major programs to overcome clinical diagnostic challenges in celiac disease, food allergy disorders, malnutrition, coronary artery disease, hearing loss, GI cancer, and cystic fibrosis, among others. Novel technologies are created using device development processes and tested and validated in over 15 ongoing single- and multi-center clinical studies.

An SEI-er is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI-ers keenly understand how to adjust their support and problem solving based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, SEI-ers possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.

As super-connectors, they connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences. Mature, humble, and genuine, SEI-ers frequently go above and beyond for both their clients and their colleagues. SEI-ers are ethical and trustworthy individuals who consistently and repeatedly follow through, and hold true to their values in difficult situations. SEI-ers have an insatiable curiosity and love to learn. These individuals are commonly tech savvy and early adopters. Their passion for learning is infectious and excites others. As every project is different, an SEI-er must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. SEI-ers define ambition differently. They are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who truly enjoy one another- they like to hang out with colleagues outside of work, collaborate and hold one another accountable. SEI-ers enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends, and family.

We are seeking a Principal Data Scientist to join our team to join our team for this hybrid opportunity working out of our Waltham, MA; Austin, TX; or St. Petersburg, FL offices. We are also extending this as a remote opportunity to candidates located in the Chicago, IL metropolitan area.

Job Summary

The Data Science team is responsible for building out the machine learning capabilities of Imprivata’s Digital Identity Platform, with specific projects ranging from detecting patient privacy violations to using machine learning to empower what would be otherwise manual workflows. As a Principal Data Scientist, you’ll be deeply involved in every aspect of the project lifecycle, including gathering requirements, cleaning and exploring datasets, running machine learning experiments, and deploying services to production.

Duties and Responsibilities

Put ethics and security first. The datasets that we use almost invariably contain PHI or similarly sensitive information, and we take the responsibility that comes with that access seriously.
Drive business value with machine learning. That includes everything from initial framing of the problem, to pulling and working with data, to training models, to communicating results.
Write high quality, production Python code. While we work closely with other engineering teams, we don’t hand off research code to be productionized by someone else – we own our solutions end-to-end and do our best to keep raising the technical bar.
Build a breadth of machine learning knowledge. Beyond actually training models, you’ll rely on that fluency when it comes to tasks like gathering requirements or iterating on model output with subject matter experts.
Communicate effectively. Taking your project from business problem to production service isn’t a solo exercise; you’ll need to work well with people from other teams and our own in order to succeed.
Improve the team. Everyone is responsible for making the team better: as a Principal Data Scientist, you’ll have an informal mentorship role by way of things like pair programming and providing meaningful code reviews.

Qualifications

Excellent problem solving skills.
Solid experience with Python and common Data Science packages, such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn. Additional experience with relevant packages such as PyTorch, Dask, Pydantic a plus.
Strong understanding of standard machine learning techniques such as classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction.
Deep expertise in one or more areas of machine learning, such as deep learning, natural language processing, graph methods, etc.
Proficiency with SQL and relational databases.
Experience working in a Unix environment.
5-7 years of data science experience and bachelors degree in computer science, machine learning or similar.

","Boston, MA",$92K - $126K (Glassdoor est.),3.9,"WHO WE LOOK FOR

An SEI-er is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI-ers keenly understand how to adjust their support and problem solving based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, SEI-ers possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.

As super-connectors, they connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences. Mature, humble, and genuine, SEI-ers frequently go above and beyond for both their clients and their colleagues. SEI-ers are ethical and trustworthy individuals who consistently and repeatedly follow through, and hold true to their values in difficult situations. SEI-ers have an insatiable curiosity and love to learn. These individuals are commonly tech savvy and early adopters. Their passion for learning is infectious and excites others. As every project is different, an SEI-er must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. SEI-ers define ambition differently. They are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who truly enjoy one another- they like to hang out with colleagues outside of work, collaborate and hold one another accountable. SEI-ers enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends, and family.

Vice President, Data Science – Systems Engineering


The Role


The main area of work for the Systems team is training and inference for deep learning models (e.g., LLMs). We are currently heavily exploiting GPT-4, soon expect to be doing the same for Google’s LLM offering. These are powerful systems capable of delivering good language processing functionality across a wide range of tasks. However, they are slow and not necessarily as good on narrow tasks as small systems that have been specifically trained for the task. We need the capability to train (pre-train, fine tune) our own (small, fast) models, and deploy them for efficient inference. This includes (“distillation”) models that are trained on data generated from the more powerful LLMs.


You are a skilled, experienced Deep Learning Engineer to lead for this team. You must have significant hands-on experience on all aspects of developing, training, optimizing, and deploying deep learning models in production. You should have a sound grounding in machine learning fundamentals, and deep knowledge of the entire training and evaluation lifecycle – including acquiring and building out the large data sets needed for training. You should have a thorough background in existing deep learning stacks (Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, …). You should have hands-on knowledge of important developments in this fast-moving field – LORA, PEFT, quantization, optimization techniques used to get efficient inference performance. You should have a demonstrated track record of working with such models (eg in the context of open source LLMs such as Llama, MPT, Falcon, Mistral) and deploying them for production use. You should be an expert in the tools of the trade – Python, git, MLFlow tools such as WandB – know how to organize, run, evaluate a series of experiments for establishing basic theses for new LLM training. You should have demonstrated experience leading deep learning engineering teams and proven track record of mentoring young engineers in this space.


The Expertise and Skills You Bring


Master's in Machine Learning / Statistics or associated discipline + at least five years of industrial or research experience. PhD preferred.

Extremely strong systems skills necessary.

We celebrate and support one another – from big and small things in life to big career moments. And giving back is in our DNA (we get 10 days off each year to do just that).

We know that powering an inclusive future starts with us. Because without diversity and a dedication to equality, there is no moving forward. Our 30 Inclusive Communities, that bring people together around commonalities or passions, are leading the way.

","Boston, MA",$88K - $143K (Glassdoor est.),5.0,"Inclusively is partnering with a multinational financial services company to hire a Vice President, Data Science- Systems Engineering (HYBRID).

ABOUT INCLUSIVELY:

Inclusively is a digital tech platform that connects candidates with disabilities, who may benefit from workplace accommodations, to inclusive employers. This includes all disabilities under the ADA, including mental health conditions (e.g. anxiety, depression, PTSD), chronic illnesses (e.g. diabetes, Long COVID), and neurodivergence (e.g. autism, ADHD). Applicants with one or more of these conditions are encouraged to apply; Inclusively does not require applicants to disclose their specific disability.

The Role

The main area of work for the Systems team is training and inference for deep learning models (e.g., LLMs). We are currently heavily exploiting GPT-4, soon expect to be doing the same for Google’s LLM offering. These are powerful systems capable of delivering good language processing functionality across a wide range of tasks. However, they are slow and not necessarily as good on narrow tasks as small systems that have been specifically trained for the task. We need the capability to train (pre-train, fine tune) our own (small, fast) models, and deploy them for efficient inference. This includes (“distillation”) models that are trained on data generated from the more powerful LLMs.

You are a skilled, experienced Deep Learning Engineer to lead for this team. You must have significant hands-on experience on all aspects of developing, training, optimizing, and deploying deep learning models in production. You should have a sound grounding in machine learning fundamentals, and deep knowledge of the entire training and evaluation lifecycle – including acquiring and building out the large data sets needed for training. You should have a thorough background in existing deep learning stacks (Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, …). You should have hands-on knowledge of important developments in this fast-moving field – LORA, PEFT, quantization, optimization techniques used to get efficient inference performance. You should have a demonstrated track record of working with such models (eg in the context of open source LLMs such as Llama, MPT, Falcon, Mistral) and deploying them for production use. You should be an expert in the tools of the trade – Python, git, MLFlow tools such as WandB – know how to organize, run, evaluate a series of experiments for establishing basic theses for new LLM training. You should have demonstrated experience leading deep learning engineering teams and proven track record of mentoring young engineers in this space.

The Expertise and Skills You Bring

Master's in Machine Learning / Statistics or associated discipline + at least five years of industrial or research experience. PhD preferred.

Extremely strong systems skills necessary.

The Team

At the Asset Management Artificial Intelligence Center of Excellence (AM AI-COE), we are bringing in groundbreaking AI technologies to the Company’s Asset Management.

Our Client

We are a venture-backed startup building the infrastructure layer for Property & Casualty (P&C) insurance. Integrating technology in the insurance industry today is much like consumer finance pre-Plaid (we could succinctly be described as ""Plaid for Insurance""), or payments pre-Stripe, and our vision is to unlock a similar wave of innovation for the $2T global P&C industry.

Today, walking into an insurance agency is like stepping into a time machine. Filing cabinets, fax machines, piles of incoming and outgoing mail. What you don't see is that even for the parts that have been ""digitized"", needless manual work abounds. Few systems communicate directly, leading to endless copy-pasting from emails to various proprietary web portals/desktop apps and back again.

Carrier by carrier, endpoint by endpoint, we will bring each of those manual and error-prone workflows into our simple, modern API layer.

The implementation details are subject to change, but this is our north star, and the future we envision isn't possible without it.

What we're looking for

We are seeking a highly autonomous engineer (employee #2!) excited about owning the design and implementation of a robust, API-driven product and playing a foundational role in the formation of the company.

Responsibilities
You'll work closely with the team and early customers to build a world-class, API-driven product.
You'll solve hard technical problems from scratch, owning the solution through the entire development lifecycle.
You'll help define the tech stack/architecture for a fledgling product — we're technology agnostic and focus using the right tool for the job.
You'll contribute to the creation of the team culture, as well as internal tooling and processes.
Role requirements
4+ years professional backend/full-stack engineering experience. Working on large-scale open-source projects works too. You've played significant roles in either API design, building processing pipelines, or systemic integration of external systems.
Early-stage startup experience (or other similar unstructured, fast-paced environment)
Live in or willing to relocate to the Bay Area to work full-time in our SF office
Nice to haves
Experience with web scraping, email scraping, RPA — in general just getting data creatively out of hard-to-reach places
1+ years TypeScript/JavaScript experience in a professional or large-scale OSS setting. If you have a comprehensive side project you think is equivalent, send it our way! Clear, concise, and extensible code is important to us and collaborating with others is often a forcing function to that end.
Experience integrating with low tech industries, or other time spent integrating with poorly documented, antiquated APIs (and sometimes even a lack thereof)
Why you should join us
Opportunity to be a foundational team member to a well-funded, post-product and -revenue startup in a massive and largely untapped industry.
Hard backend engineering problems on day 1. Backend is all we do, and the projects you'll work on will be challenging and interesting.
Generous equity comp (90th+ percentile) and competitive cash comp (50th percentile). As we're a startup, we're happy to play with the balance for exceptional candidates.
The Founding Team

Our CEO is a strong engineer in his own right (Waterloo grad, senior eng at multiple Bay Area startups) but will be focusing on the business/product side. He’s gone super deep on insurance, including getting a Broker License and a stint as an Insurtech EIR at a top VC firm.

We’ve raised funding from great investors including top seed funds, ex-Plaid folks, and insurance industry insiders.

Today, tens of millions of consumers visit CarGurus.com each month, and ~30,000 dealerships use our products. But they're not the only ones who love CarGurus—our employees do, too. We have a people-first culture that fosters kindness, collaboration, and innovation, and empowers our Gurus with tools to fuel their career growth. Disrupting a trillion-dollar industry requires fresh and diverse perspectives. Come join us for the ride!

Role overview

We are looking for a Senior Product Data Analyst to join our Special Projects team which tackles complex and unstructured projects that span across our numerous business verticals. You will frequently collaborate with various embedded product analytics teams to provide support and innovate for challenging builds and analyses.

Our Product Data Analytics org as a whole supports our Product and Engineering teams, providing the final word on all analytics for CarGurus' user and dealer experiences. We are looking for thoughtful, curious, internally driven candidates who can dive into complex data and draw novel, insightful conclusions.

What you'll tackle

Exploration: Using your SQL expertise, conduct exploratory empirical analyses that bridge disparate data sources (e.g. website usage, subscription records, inventory volumes, etc.) to quantify product performance, user behavior, and/or market trends. Doing so will require distilling unstructured ""big data"" into actionable insights. Creatively compress sweeping, high-level exploratory requests into specific calculations that address your stakeholders' underlying needs. Relentlessly dig into the data – consulting with other individuals and teams as you judge necessary – beyond the letter of the initial assignment, to hammer out any anomalies or self-direct your inquiry into other relevant issues. Be comfortable escalating and automating your analyses using R/Python scripting.
Experimentation: Be the authority on A/B experimentation, advising engineers and product managers on everything from the necessary data points to collect, required sample sizes, optimal metrics to examine, robustness of numerical findings, and the bottom-line success or failure of the tested changes. Provide technical guidance on and ideas for improving A/B testing-related tools, algorithms, and automated processes. Conduct self-directed research on the latest trends in A/B experimentation, and map out internal improvements based on your findings.
Advocacy: Advocate for specific, data-driven product innovations that help further high-level company strategy, primarily in partnership with the Product/Engineering teams. Participate in brainstorming and planning discussions across the organization to these ends. Avoid passivity in the face of flawed proposals; tactfully and persuasively push back against potential missteps.
Metrics: Craft the metrics that define business success, condensing abstract or loosely-defined concepts down to concrete calculations. Audit and improve existing metrics to better inform the business' needs.
Visualizations: Build intuitive dashboards and other visual monitoring tools to guide daily decision-making by senior stakeholders and the company at large. Experiment with new kinds of visualizations that you believe could be better utilized in the organization. Re-work underlying code to appropriately structure visualization inputs.
Communication: Communicate and present complex quantitative findings in easily digestible terms to company leadership, homing in on key takeaways. Concretely and informatively respond to any probing, on-the-spot follow-up questions from senior decision-makers.
Architecture: Conceive of new data assets and build automated transformations (via DBT, LookML, etc.) to bring them to fruition. Partner with Data Engineering teams to advance core data modeling/architecture (e.g. user clickstream logging), by optimizing, integrating, and distilling large raw datasets and metadata. Draw upon prior experience with expansive, unrefined datasets to fix modeling bottlenecks in quick, scalable, outside-of-the-box ways.

Who you are

Bachelors/Masters Degree with 4+ years (or PhD with 2+ years) of experience in an analytics or analytics-adjacent field, ideally involving complex data modeling, quantitative analysis, and applied statistics.
2+ years of experience communicating the results of analyses to leadership teams to influence strategy
Expert fluency in SQL. Strong background with either R or Python is highly desirable.
Second-nature understanding of core statistical concepts (regression, significance testing, omitted variable bias, independence/dependence, etc.)
Knack for creative data visualizations.
Willingness to step outside your role and independently come up with novel ideas for the business.
Willingness to challenge others' ideas and advocate for your own.
Excellent verbal and written communication skills. Very comfortable presenting high-impact and potentially sensitive findings to senior leadership.
Strong project planning skills, with experience building roadmaps, estimating required resources, and flagging inter-dependencies with other teams/projects.
Preferred tools/programs: Snowflake, Snowplow, DBT, Looker, Jira, Salesforce, Google/MS suite
