The team enjoys the duality of solving humongous research and engineering problems, while remaining focused on very concrete shorter-term breakthroughs. We believe in excellence, humility, trust and inclusion, and every team member has a veto power on who we hire.

We adopt a finance-first approach to machine learning research, and we do not indulge in blindly applying solutions to machine learning problems in other domains to finance. Core to our research philosophy is the need to place as little assumptions on how the world behaves as possible, but rather let the data speak for itself, and use mathematical rigor to understand what the data is truly saying.

We are backed by Y Combinator, legendary Renaissance Technologies and First Round Capital co-founder Howard Morgan, and prominent tech VCs David Lee & Zal Bilimoria, to name but a few.


Pit.AI Technologies is hiring a Mathematical Scientist. You'll be at the core of our effort to solve intelligence for investment management, and as such, you'll work very closely with the CEO/CTO to improve our current generation of AI-Quants.


This role is an in-house mathematician role. As such, you'll be involved in formulating fundamental questions arising as part of the investment process as mathematical problems consistent with our research philosophy, and you'll be responsible for solving those mathematical problems. This role is central to our research efforts, and your output is expected to have a critical impact on our bottom line, both in the short term and in the long term.


The ideal candidate typically loves (and is capable of) testing and proving complex theorems and conjectures of her/his own, but prefers industry over academia as she/he is eager and impatient to see the impact of her/his work in real-life. She/he never shies away from finding closed-form solutions to complex mathematical problems, but she/he can also gauge the merits of numerical methods as an alternative when appropriate. As much as this is not an engineering role, the ideal candidate should be able to write prototype-quality Python code to test found mathematical results.


Pit.AI Technologies supports publications of methodological findings to top machine learning venues.


We strongly encourage applicants to read our blog posts (http://bit.ly/2Jf97aV) prior to applying, in order to get acquainted with our research philosophy and some of our works.


Requirements:

Ph.D. / Post Doc in Maths from a top university or research group, with an emphasis on stochastic analysis, optimization, and/or functional analysis.
Excellent graduate-level understanding of probability theory, stochastic analysis, functional analysis and optimization, as evidenced for instance by a French DEA in maths, or the Cambridge Part III, prior to your PhD in Maths.

Description

Description:

High Energy Astrophysics (HEA) data contain a wealth of information about some of the most complex and fascinating astrophysical phenomena. Over 50 legacy missions, 10 active missions, and many planned missions have collected HEA data which have been or will be archived in the NASA High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center (HEASARC). Due to its complexity, however, much of this data remains unexploited by new techniques involving Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML).

Galactic and extragalactic high-energy sources span a broad range of astrophysical phenomena: X-ray binaries, black holes, galaxies, cataclysmic variables, and supernova remnants are but a few of these. The HEA data emitted by these sources reveals clues as to the mechanisms driving their processes. This data is as rich and diverse as the sources themselves, worthy of intensive research using the most advanced methods.

As such, NASA seeks a post-doctoral fellow, as part of the NPP program, to examine data contained in the HEASARC using AI/ML methods. This fellow will use both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to approach HEA data in order to further our understanding of HEA sources.

Examples of areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

Discovery of new and interesting sources in X-ray survey data
Classification of unknown HEA sources
Using X-ray timing data to predict source behavior
Characterization of chaotic X-ray source emissions
Source clustering and anomaly detection

Candidates should have a strong background in both astrophysics and data science or machine learning. Candidates must also have experience or training in software and algorithm development, particularly in employing AI/ML techniques on large data sets.

Description:

Understanding how the Sun operates is the cornerstone of our ability to predict solar activity on long and short time scales. The project aims to study the solar activity phenomena from the interior to the corona through a comprehensive analysis of observational data from space and ground-based observatories, such as magnetograms, subsurface flows, solar oscillations, and others. This research will enable the development of a new generation of data assimilation models to predict solar activity. The project goal will be achieved through state-of-the-art data analysis and modeling techniques, machine-learning approaches, principal component analysis, and others. The research plan includes collecting and analyzing observational data in the form of a data processing pipeline, including data from Solar Dynamics Observatory and other space missions, with possible extension to historical (e.g., Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) and ground-based observations. In addition, advanced mathematical methods of data analysis, theoretical models, and simulations will be employed to cross-analyze the diverse data sets and models and investigate various aspects of solar activity. Therefore, this opportunity encourages collaborations of researchers from heliophysics, magnetohydrodynamics, computational physics, and data and computer sciences.

The Roku Culture

Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor.

We’re independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.
