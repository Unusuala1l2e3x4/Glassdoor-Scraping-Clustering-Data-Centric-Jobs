This represents a crucial and inadequately explored area of investigation, as a deeper understanding of the immune states in AML may offer insights into the pathogenesis of this heterogeneous disease and may pave the way for more targeted therapies. As a member of the project team, you will learn the analysis methods, as well as the conceptual and biological background, to analyze CITEseq and single-cell RNA sequencing data. Once comfortable with these methods, under direct supervision, you will perform analyses to contribute to our understanding of immune state in our patient cohorts. You will integrate molecular data with clinical information in an effort to understand how the immune system impacts disease outcomes. You will be expected to document your analyses, present your progress and results, and participate in lab meetings.

We currently have several projects examining the relationship between immune state and health outcomes in cancer. Our aim is to better understand how the immune system is wired and responds, in order to develop better disease diagnosis and treatments. As a member of the lab you will contribute to the design of new experiments, help maintain our computational infrastructure, and track the flow of samples and information for large-scale studies. This position is in Dr. Gaensler’s Lab, and will contribute to IND-enabling studies. Projects involve assessing the responsiveness of cells, such as T cells, profiled in flow cytometric and CITEseq studies, to novel therapies in established ex-vivo coculture assays. These innovative approaches can also uncover predictive correlations that may inform the development of novel treatment strategies for AML.

While this position requires some proficiency in programming and data analysis, candidates who are fast and eager learners, who can readily adopt new bioinformatics pipelines/workflows that have been developed in the lab and the field at-large and apply them to a series of projects can be successful in this role. An aptitude for collaborative work and organization is required to excel in our enviornment. You will receive training in data analysis, as well as develop expertise and intuition in biology. This position is ideal for recent graduates and can serve as a stepping stone for a graduate program or career in bioinformatics, computational biology, or data science.

You move quickly. You’re already augmented by LLMs. You are able to rapidly evaluate, apply, and productize AI technologies.

You are skilled in using a range of AI tools for chaining, retrieval, and vector search, and evaluations.

You have a strong grasp of prompt engineering, enabling you to effectively interact with language models to elicit desired responses or behaviors.

Examples of what you’ll do

As an AI Engineer, you will work closely with the product team to enhance the performance and accuracy of our LLM-based reasoning engine, memory module, evaluation stack, and simulation environment.

You will apply the latest AI developments to our product, ensuring that Lasso remains at the cutting edge of AI technology.

You will help us iterate towards product-market fit in an early-stage, open-ended environment.

Embody our end users (engineers with operational responsibilities), immersing yourself in their needs, pains, and aspirations.

How we work:

Less is more: Small teams deliver impactful outcomes. Our focus is on meaningful work rather than long hours.

Culture is critical: We value excitement and chemistry. We only bring in the right people who align with our vision.

Transparent compensation: We’ll give you levers to adjust your compensation. $120k-$160k base, and 0.5-1% equity. 401k matching. Great healthcare.

We’re in-person: We move faster when we work from the same room. We have offices in Singapore and San Francisco. We’re flexible, but prefer in-person.

An AI-first approach: We don't simply build AI products; we augment ourselves with it.

Interview process:

The whole process takes less than one day

Screen: A quick call with one of the founders.

Founding AI+Remote Sensing Engineer,Terradot,United States,-1,-1.0,"Terradot
Our mission is to accelerate gigaton-scale soil carbon sequestration around the world

Problem

Globally, soils have the potential to sequester over 1 billion tons of carbon through regenerative agriculture practices and emerging solutions like biochar and enhanced rock weathering. However today, measurement, reporting, and verification of soil carbon sequestration is not cost effective, accurate, or scalable. This prevents large-scale climate finance from being deployed to rapidly scale soil carbon improvement despite its massive potential to combat climate change, improve food security, and alleviate extreme poverty.

Company

Terradot is building technology to accelerate gigaton-scale soil carbon removal and storage around the world. To start, we are building the world's best global measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) platform to accelerate high-integrity soil carbon sequestration. With Stanford’s Soil and Environmental Biogeochemistry Lab, we leverage technological innovation using ground truth sampling, remote sensing, and AI modeling to accurately and scalably measure soil carbon. For soil carbon project developers, Terradot decreases the time, cost, and complexity of MRV while increasing the integrity of the carbon removal credits for carbon buyers. This enables the large-scale deployment of climate finance to incentivize the adoption of sustainable practices. We are focused on improving soil health in emerging economies to maximize global sequestration and community impact.

We are a public-benefit corporation driven by passion and purpose in service to our planet, people, and prosperity. Terradot is backed by world-class investors including Floodgate, John Doerr, Kleiner Perkins, Sheryl Sandberg, Ponderosa Ventures, 776 Foundation (Alexis Ohanian), George Roberts, and Stanford’s TomKat Center for Sustainable Energy. We are advised by an all-star team of Stanford climate professors with 100,000+ citations collectively.

Values

Curiosity: Most solutions to reach net zero do not exist yet. We are looking for sensationally curious team players who use a beginner’s mindset to find novel solutions and embrace the growth mindset to overcome setbacks
Kindness: Great teams change the world, we believe kindness is the foundation to build great teams on and also guides the impact we aim to have on our planet to pay it forward.
Mamba Mentality: Kobe Bryant’s Mamba Mentality combines love, passion, and borderline obsession to improve every day and create a culture of collectively becoming the best we can be at our shared dream.
Speed and Scale: We value teammates who are ready to move at the speed and scale necessary to meet the urgency of the climate crisis. If you are looking to coast, stick to big tech.
