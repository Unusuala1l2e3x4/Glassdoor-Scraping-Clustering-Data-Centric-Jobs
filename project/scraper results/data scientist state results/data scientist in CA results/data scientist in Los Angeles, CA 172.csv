If the work diminishes agency, we may simply decide to “eff” it after all.

Our work environment is fantastic for aspiring coders, calculators, and entrepreneurs. Also, we have neither VC, nor PE, nor other acronyms funding us. We have a weird business model where we sell our work for a profit and use those profits to pay people (I told you it was weird!).

More specifically, we deploy the proceeds from our consulting work in development and data science and our skunkworks proceeds to support research into cause areas we think are of paramount interest to human beings. We have made a name for ourselves in cutting-edge brain computer interface (BCI) R&D, and now we want to replicate past successes and solve the problem of AI alignment (aligning future powerful systems with human best interests). We want to optimize for human agency, if you feel similarly, please to support our research efforts. Data scientists will have the opportunity between client projects to work on important alignment research, with the opportunity to potentially have your research project prioritized if particularly promising.

ABOUT YOU
Fluency in Python–used often, derided occasionally, and considered its eponymous reference to the best of British sketch comedy
Proven data science experience–primary or equal contributor, multiple smaller projects, management of steak-holders (so projects come out ‘well-done’)
Comfort with the statistics and methods deployed in classification problems–that is, the ability to see the random forest for the trees
Familiarity with NLP/NLU–even if this posting’s language is a bit unnatural, we suspect you’ll understand our process
Experience calling machine learning APIs via REST or client libraries - and determining that their responses lack wit, guile, and tact
Agile experience (worked with Kanban, Scrum, Extreme Programming)–or a sound literary understanding of Steve Martin’s “Picasso at the Lapin Agile,” even if you don’t speak French
Growth mindset – You had better be funnier after the first 90 days...
Willingness to learn our systems (wait, we have systems?)
Full-time availability–but if you have cool side projects that increase human agency, we totally want you to keep working on it...we’ll even help!
Demonstrated ability to work independently/autonomously
Ability to communicate effectively and work exclusively in English. This is a must, our ability to crack jokes in other languages is decidedly de rigeur...
BONUS POINTS FOR
Experience with self-managed data science projects–show us your cool side hustles, especially if they increase human agency or include obscure references!
Software development background - We need help with syntax in English too...

You care about AI alignment, and are optimistic in humanity’s capacity to problem solve and safely navigate accelerating AI capabilities and have an awesome future

Equity

Working at AE means receiving equity in some of our client projects and in the Skunkworks projects we incubate. The equity granted is priced at a value of $0 when you receive it. If it were otherwise, you’d be forced to pay taxes. But to be clear, there are no free lunches, only the choice of who pays for your sandwich.

At AE, the equity you receive is not free to AE. We invest millions annually in Skunkworks projects - paying our employees to build technology for which no client pays a bill. We receive equity from certain clients, which means we accept less in terms of our billable rate. We then pass that equity on to our employees. Sure it’s priced at $0 on day 1 - a call option on a stock trading at $100 with a strike price of $100 is priced at $0 today for tax purposes, but you’d want to receive that option. If you received that option on a dozen stocks, you’d be fairly confident that some of them would be worth a lot more than $0.

Offering this equity (by investing in Skunkworks or offering clients a lower rate) comes out of AE’s margins. Theoretically, we should be lowering salaries to compensate. But we’re competitive on that front as well. Over the long-term, we believe AE employees who stick around are likely to fare extremely well monetarily (no legal promises). We think long-term. You should too when you choose your employer.

We are looking to hire people who think long term. People create exponentially more value here in their 3rd or 4th year rather than their 1st or 2nd, and that only increases. The value you create leads to more equity issued every year, and you retain it while you remain at AE or at a Skunkworks co that spins out, in order to free up equity for others, which is how we afford to be generous with the equity.

Disclaimer: If you leave AE on good terms, you can retain 20% of your equity if you continue to send leads our way, share our core values, etc. If you leave AE for your own AE-incubated Skunkworks project (or someone else’s), you retain 100% of your equity. Folks create exponentially more value here in their 3rd and 4th years than their 1st or 2nd - we want folks who think long-term like we do.

Salary range from $120k/year to $220k/year. Not in the range? That's fine, you can still and our team may fit you in a more senior position that we're not actively hiring right now, but we are growing fast and may have other openings soon.

Description

Description:

Jupiter’s moon Europa is a prime candidate in the search for life beyond Earth. NASA’s Europa Clipper mission aims to investigate the habitability of this icy world with a suite of 10 science instruments when it arrives at the moon in the early 2030’s. Of particular interest is the characterization of Europa’s subsurface ocean by using its magnetic induction response measured by the Europa Clipper Magnetometer [1]. The largest source of noise in this measurement is by far the obscuring interaction field created by the interaction of Jupiter’s corotating magnetospheric plasma with Europa’s atmosphere and therefore need to be accounted for [2]. These fields are typically simulated with Magnetohydrodynamic Modelling (MHD); however, these simulations require significant computation time (e.g. supercomputers) and are therefore extremely resource intensive.

The aim of this project is to use advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, trained on outputs from already developed MHD simulations, to emulate the space environment and ionosphere of Europa and other moons in the solar system [3]. By doing so, we will be able to approximate the functionality of dedicated MHD simulations using parameterized models at a fraction of the computing cost. This will be extremely useful to generate simulations on the fly, thus enabling Monte Carlo error analyses where the plasma parameter space is not entirely certain [4]. These simulations will be very valuable for determining how well the induction response from ocean worlds can be extracted in the presence of plasma interactions at Europa and other icy worlds in the solar system in which NASA intends to visit. Additionally, we hope to incorporate existing physical models, such as magnetospheric particle bombardment, into the AI models, thus enhancing their applicability. The project will utilize in-situ data from Voyager, Galileo, and Juno, in preparation for the upcoming Europa Clipper and JUICE missions. Not only will this work have a significant impact on the ability to model the space environment at the Jovian moons, but could also be adapted to the large moons of Uranus and Neptune where the space environment is essentially unknown, thus providing use for potential future Discovery and Flagship missions to those environments.

The postdoctoral fellow will work with Dr. Corey Cochrane to build the AI models, couple them with the existing physical models, analyze results and disseminate findings to the relevant communities. The fellow will collaborate with members of the Europa Clipper Science Team to apply the AI models in preparation for Clipper’s arrival at Europa.

Description

Description:

Current and future cosmology missions in the big data era of astronomy can greatly benefit from advances in deep learning. Architectures based on convolutional neural networks (e.g., GANs, deep image prior, diffusion probabilistic models) are well tested for applications such as image generation, data/image to image translation, feature/domain transfer, or super resolution. These applications could notably enhance astronomical measurements from combined data sets. For instance, images boosted in depth and/or resolution can be used to increase the number of usable sources for weak lensing, reduce the systematics errors due to blending, photometric redshifts, and shape measurements, and potentially put tighter constraints on the cosmological parameters measurable through weak lensing. Data from the current ground- and space-based surveys (with e.g., HSC, KiDS+Viking, DES, HST) will be used to quantify the gain for the upcoming missions (i.e., Rubin, Euclid, Roman, and SPherex) with heavy JPL, Caltech and IPAC contributions. We are seeking a postdoctoral fellow to lead this effort. Experience with deep learning frameworks is highly desirable, and familiarity with multi-band spectro/photometric galaxy data of existing and future cosmology missions as well as a broad knowledge of weak lensing systematics is preferred. The successful candidate will be working closely with Dr. Eric Huff and Dr. Shoubaneh Hemmati and other members of the cosmology team at JPL.

Description

Description:

Long-term records of the tropospheric composition are important for understanding the changes in air pollution such as ozone and aerosols and their impact on human health and climate. Satellite measurements provide critical information about these changing global patterns, but the synthesis of these data to infer processes driving those patterns remains a challenge.

In order to provide comprehensive information on atmospheric composition variations and to characterize decadal changes in air pollutant emissions, we have been developing a new a state-of-the-art chemical data assimilation system, MOMO-Chem, that ingests a suite of multi-constituent retrievals from multiple NASA’s satellites. We have used this system to generate the tropospheric chemistry reanalysis version 2, TCR-2, and to quantify emission changes and their impacts on ozone for the past decade.

This project will apply the multi-constituent chemical data assimilation to new multi-constituent data from the Aura, Terra, Aqua, Suomi-NPP, Sentinel-5P satellites and provide understanding of processes that form ozone and aerosols and attribute changes in their concentrations to short- and long-term variations in human and natural activity at both regional and global scales. By adding new satellite measurements to the existing assimilated measurements, we will be able to simultaneously optimize anthropogenic and biogenic emissions of NOx, SO2, CO, and NH3 and to better represent the interactions between trace gases and aerosols. The project will provide enhanced understanding of multi-year changes in air pollutants and their response to changes in emission efficiency and human activity.

Combining with other NASA’s datasets, such as aircraft measurements and carbon flux products, and advanced techniques such as machine learning, this project will provide crucial new understanding relevant to NASA’s Atmospheric Composition Focus Area’s science questions of ”How is atmospheric composition changing?” and ”What are the effects of global atmospheric composition and climate changes on regional air quality?” and to the Earth Science objectives in the 2020 NASA Science Strategy Plan.
