GSS is responsible for delivering product-led, people-powered services that help our customers operate their business securely on AWS, and we are accelerating our adoption of AI/ML. This is an exciting opportunity to contribute at the intersection of AI/ML, cloud, and cyber security. Your primary responsibility will be to envision, experiment, prototype, and mature to scale AI/ML solutions in our products to meet the needs of our customers. You will have the opportunity to work with multiple lines of business, and learn from (and contribute to) a variety of security use cases. This is a hands-on role where success is measured by producing solutions that have measurable impact.

The GSS team leverages the expertise and ingenuity of our builders to establish scalable security solutions for both internal and external customers that drive business outcomes. Our goal of securing the world’s workloads and building a brighter future for humanity requires us to focus on reliable delivery of bar raising security outcomes and investment in security mechanisms and automation on behalf of our customers.

Advocate for the proper use of AI/ML for security across GSS and Global Services generally. Help guide, teach, and influence others about AI/ML.
Partner with multiple business lines of GSS to understand security use cases and identify appropriate AI/ML opportunities.

A day in the life
Your day (or week) is a mix of meeting with product and service owners in GSS, sharing information and guidance, and doing hands-on modeling. In the morning, you meet with one of the product teams to understand their user stories and identify the right opportunities for AI/ML. After your meeting this morning about the experimental results, you have two more variations to try before a final decision can be made with the product team. Alternatively, you might pick up where you left off tuning your model for a different product that’s further along. Your accuracy and recall meet the thresholds the product team thinks customers will expect, but you think you can get a few percentage point improvement after talking with some data science colleagues in our Professional Services team last week. Before you close things down for the day, you do a quick check of your on-line messages to see if anything urgent arose while you were head-down on the ML work - but there’s nothing there that can’t wait until tomorrow.

"Postdoctoral Research Associate, School of Data Science","Commonwealth of Virginia
","Charlottesville, VA",$73K - $99K (Glassdoor est.),3.4,"The School of Data Science (SDS) at the University of Virginia (UVA) seeks a postdoctoral research associate to work in collaboration with the Jeff Bleich Center, Flinders University of South Australia, exploring issues that relate to collective US-Australia-UK cooperation relevant to national security and wellbeing at a time when society is being transformed by the use and misuse of digital data. This is a one-year appointment; however, appointment may be renewed for an additional year contingent upon available funding and satisfactory performance.

More specifically, in an era of increasing reliance on open-source intelligence (OSI), how can we ensure responsible use of AI as applied to the analysis and interpretation of that OSI (as well as decisions made on the basis of such analysis)? Whilst numerous ethical frameworks for the use of AI have been developed and discussed, how can we ensure that they are fit for purpose and appropriate across various global contexts. A vast range of OSI sources are available, encompassing social media, news reports, commercial and other real time data, which offer up to the minute insights into regional and global developments, but these are only as reliable as their inputs. The use of AI in a national security context offers great benefits and consequent risks. As the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) notes in a recent report on The Future of Open-Source Intelligence for UK National Security “purchased datasets are only as good as those providing the filtration”. The Report therefore advocates for specialist officers who can work “closely with suppliers to ensure the data being provided is secure and accurate”. This implies a need for strict application of ethical and legal frameworks and highly trained humans in the loop to manage such risks.

This research project would consider the ethical and legal issues relevant to the application of AI and open-source intelligence in a national security context. Recent published research establishes that to date very little work has been done in this area. Major questions to be addressed are:

What are existing successes and failures in the application of AI and open-source intelligence in a national security context?

What differences in the policies and laws surrounding open-source intelligence data among the three allies impact the application of responsible AI?

What recommendations can be made to further the ethical application and resultant security of the IS-Australia-UK alliance when using AI on open-source intelligence.




Qualifications:

A PhD in a relevant field of study by the start date of the position.

An understanding of AI and open-source intelligence.

Demonstrated multidisciplinary approach to the analysis of the strategic implications of digital technologies.

Demonstrated ability to comprehend complex contemporary issues in defence, social cybersecurity, digital governance; trust in the strategic environment; networks and data management.

Demonstrated well-developed interpersonal skills and experience in collaborating and engaging with diverse stakeholders from academia, government and industry.
