Data Scientist (Multiple Levels),"Red Alpha LLC
","Annapolis Junction, MD",$88K - $127K (Glassdoor est.),5.0,"Description:


A little about us:

The Red Alpha Data Science practice grew out of Red Alpha's reputation in Software and System Engineering with our Department of Defense clients. As sometimes happens, customers who trust our expertise in adjacent areas asked Red Alpha to assist with some of their burgeoning Data Science problems.

Culturally, it probably suffices to say that we take our work seriously, but not ourselves. Our leaders have spent time in the trenches and have cursed daylight savings time changes and trailing whitespace as many times as you have. We like to say that we spend 80% of our time cleaning the data...and 20% of our time complaining about cleaning the data. Joking aside, our voices matter, and it is easy to see how our decisions affect the Data Science practice and Red Alpha as a whole. We have a clear vision of where we are headed.

Our team takes a pragmatic approach to Data Science, defining it loosely as the intersection of technical expertise, business acumen, and soft skills to solve business problems with data. We spend a lot of time trying to understand the problem before we set about building a solution, and we prefer lower tech useful solutions over shiny algorithms and dust on the shelf. Did we mention we’re pragmatic? We have a diverse set of skills across our team, and whether you are a traditional Data Scientist (whatever that means…), an Applied Research Mathematician, a Database Engineer, a Full Stack Developer, or something else in that neighborhood, if you have a knack for picking apart data to make sense of it, we would enjoy having a conversation with you.

A day in the life:

You’ll likely start your day at a customer location near our Red Alpha offices, checking to see if there are any important items that have just come up. If not, you’ll move on to improving a dashboard or other data product that you’re responsible for, or perhaps produce a weekly output the customer is expecting. You’ll be using R or Python a lot, but also Git, Mongo, some commercial software and several other usual suspects. Once a week you’ll attend a team meeting (with 4 others) to prioritize things, and you’ll have a lot of interaction with the team otherwise, typically several times per day. You’ll need your sense of humor and need to be willing to leave your ego at the door.

Requirements:


What you bring to the table:

Now on to the fun of formal requirements - we have to apologize in advance for the corporate-speak here, but just hold your breath for a few lines and everything will be okay. We are actively hiring data professionals for roles across a broad range of skill levels and projects. Our goal is to find the best fit for you so please note that if you apply to one of them and we see a fit elsewhere we will let you know. So do not worry about applying initially for every position you might be interested in.

All of our data scientists need the following skills:

Proficiency with a scripting language such as R or Python
Experience with data science techniques and algorithms such as classification, clustering, random forests, deterministic forests (jk), hierarchical modeling, deep learning, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and others. Note that you do not need to have all of these (we hope you enjoyed our random smattering of techniques…!) but you should be comfortable and capable with several of them and know some others not on this list.
A B.S. Degree in Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science or related field.
For entry-level data scientists, 0-3 years of experience on Data Science projects.
For mid-level data scientists, 3-6 years of experience on Data Science projects.
For senior-level data scientists, at least 6 years of experience on Data Science projects with at least 3 years of experience managing teams.
A TS/SCI with Polygraph security clearance.

These are important skills to have, but not necessarily mandatory:

Exceptional interpersonal skills. You know, as in you might not be at the top of the list to be a game show host but you do like people and enjoy solving problems jointly with your colleagues.
Experience with Java, C, or other compiled languages
Comprehensive knowledge of Saturday Night Live sketches (just kidding)
Experience with SQL/NoSQL, Spark, Hadoop
Familiarity with Javascript and Scripting
Familiarity with Docker, GitLab, and React

Why Red Alpha?

Every day, our elite customers are pushing through ""the grind"" to defeat the enemy, even putting their lives on the line for our freedom. Rise to the occasion with us to deliver engineering excellence, to match their dedication to this nation. Join us as we bring digital transformation to the fight.

Description

The 2010 Decadal Survey; New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics (National Research Council, 2010), prescribed the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) as its highest ranked large space project for the decade. WFIRST, conceived as a filled aperture, wide field, near infrared flagship-class observatory, was proposed to settle fundamental questions about the nature of dark energy and to complete the census of all possible types of exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy using wide-field imaging onto a very large, dense detector array. To accomplish this, the mission will accumulate 256 trillion pixel images at a rate of one every 15 minutes for analysis.

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), launched in early Spring of 2019, is conducting wide-field imaging of nearly the entire celestial sphere in search of exoplanets that eclipse their host star. Tiling the sky over a period of 2 years using four large detector arrays, TESS will recover about 2.5 million photometric lightcurves for each of its 26 sectors before moving on to a survey of the Galactic plane. The community, using a crude box-least squares method, is searching this vast trove for the faint signature of exoplanets - simply discarding other sources of stellar variability as noise.

These two missions and others under consideration have one thing in common – very large, very complex data sets replete with observatory systematics and elusive, tenuous astrophysical signals. Recognizing the significant challenge this raises for the science return of TESS, WFIRST and future survey missions, NASA seeks a post doctoral fellow with the necessary data science skills to formulate a systematic approach to extraction of science in the face of extremely high data rates or in large complex archives.

Examples of areas of interest include:

Machine learning for classification of astrophysical signals
Artificial intelligence augmentation of spaceborne observatories to reduce data transmission rates
Migration of science processing to cloud-based computing
Development of highly accessible data bases with in situ computing
Graphics Processing Unit acceleration of scientific data processing

Candidates need not have a strong background in astronomy or physics to apply. Candidates must have experience or training in one or more of the following skill sets in the service of, or scalable to very large data archives or high data accumulation rates:

Description

The NASA Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, and ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission, slated for launch in 2022, will extend and improve NASA’s 20+ year record of satellite observations of global ocean biology, aerosols, and clouds. Designed and built at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), PACE will include the Ocean Color Instrument (OCI), an imaging spectrometer with sensitivity from the ultraviolet (UV) to near infrared (NIR), plus several discrete shortwave infrared bands. PACE will also have two contributed multi-angle polarimeters (MAPs), which maximize observed information about the earth’s atmosphere and ocean. Another upcoming mission is the Geostationary Littoral Imaging and Monitoring Radiometer (GLIMR), a NASA Earth Venture class hyperspectral imager devoted to coastal remote sensing from geostationary orbit.

Scientific data processing for these instruments will be performed in the NASA GSFC Ocean Ecology Laboratory (OEL), which has a long history of ocean color science data processing for instruments such as the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP). However, the hyperspectral, multi-angle, polarimetric and geostationary nature of the PACE and GLIMR missions means that the data volume will be significantly larger than in the past, and more sophisticated data analysis approaches will likely be needed in order to fully exploit these new datasets. In recognition of this challenge, NASA seeks a post-doctoral fellow with the appropriate data science skills to develop new methods of analysis, processing or otherwise.

Examples of areas of interest include:

deep learning for forward/inverse modeling
probabilistic programming
statistical analysis and inference methods
cloud computing
data reduction and mining methods
problem solving and algorithm design of complex systems using optimization methods

Candidates need not have a strong background in oceanography or atmospheric science to apply, although an interest in, and ability to understand the underlying problems is important. The role of the candidate is to seek new solutions to established problems in close collaboration with PACE domain specialists and implement them at scale. Candidates must have experience or training in one or more of the following skill sets as they apply to large datasets:

data science
computer science
statistics
artificial intelligence

Description

Description:

Until recently, returned datasets from planetary science missions beyond Earth orbit have been modest, due to the relatively small numbers of missions, and limitations in downlink bandwidth (e.g. NASA's Deep Space Network). Their sparsity has allowed for multiple generations of researchers to conduct data analysis by detailed inspection, calibration, cataloging and modeling of every byte of data. The future of planetary science bodes to be different, with increasing numbers of missions, instruments that produce vastly larger data rates and volumes, resulting in much larger amounts of data being recorded for analysis. As with Earth remote sensing, this changing exploration landscape requires a paradigm shift in how planetary science is conducted, and most especially making use of advanced computational tools to leverage the expertise of human researchers, and to make rapid analysis of very large datasets tractable. Recent advances in machine learning techniques have opened up a new frontier for tackling the 'big data' problem in planetary sciences. Successful applications so far include feature recognition and semantic segmentation of image data, feature extraction from time series data from plasma and field detection instruments, and real-time decision making on spacecraft such as Perseverance. Together with mentors at NASA GSFC, the researcher will apply machine learning techniques to image and spectroscopic data to produce new scientific results, and to devise new analysis methodologies. Results will be published in journals and presented at conferences.

Please contact the project mentor with any questions about project scope, background experience or eligibility.

Preferred Qualifications:

A post-doctoral researcher is sought with either pre-existing experience in machine learning applications in the geosciences or astronomy; or significant experience in computational techniques applied to scientific problems combined with a desire to quickly learn new techniques in machine learning. Strong computer coding skills are essential, and experience with python-based neural net architectures such as PyTorch, TensorFlow and Keras is preferable.

","Germantown, MD",$160K (Employer est.),4.0,"Who is Recruiting from Scratch :
Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.
https://www.recruitingfromscratch.com/
Our Client

We are a venture-backed startup building the infrastructure layer for Property & Casualty (P&C) insurance. Integrating technology in the insurance industry today is much like consumer finance pre-Plaid (we could succinctly be described as ""Plaid for Insurance""), or payments pre-Stripe, and our vision is to unlock a similar wave of innovation for the $2T global P&C industry.

Today, walking into an insurance agency is like stepping into a time machine. Filing cabinets, fax machines, piles of incoming and outgoing mail. What you don't see is that even for the parts that have been ""digitized"", needless manual work abounds. Few systems communicate directly, leading to endless copy-pasting from emails to various proprietary web portals/desktop apps and back again.

Carrier by carrier, endpoint by endpoint, we will bring each of those manual and error-prone workflows into our simple, modern API layer.

The implementation details are subject to change, but this is our north star, and the future we envision isn't possible without it.

What we're looking for

We are seeking a highly autonomous engineer (employee #2!) excited about owning the design and implementation of a robust, API-driven product and playing a foundational role in the formation of the company.

Responsibilities
You'll work closely with the team and early customers to build a world-class, API-driven product.
You'll solve hard technical problems from scratch, owning the solution through the entire development lifecycle.
You'll help define the tech stack/architecture for a fledgling product — we're technology agnostic and focus using the right tool for the job.
You'll contribute to the creation of the team culture, as well as internal tooling and processes.
Role requirements
4+ years professional backend/full-stack engineering experience. Working on large-scale open-source projects works too. You've played significant roles in either API design, building processing pipelines, or systemic integration of external systems.
Early-stage startup experience (or other similar unstructured, fast-paced environment)
Live in or willing to relocate to the Bay Area to work full-time in our SF office
Nice to haves
Experience with web scraping, email scraping, RPA — in general just getting data creatively out of hard-to-reach places
1+ years TypeScript/JavaScript experience in a professional or large-scale OSS setting. If you have a comprehensive side project you think is equivalent, send it our way! Clear, concise, and extensible code is important to us and collaborating with others is often a forcing function to that end.
Experience integrating with low tech industries, or other time spent integrating with poorly documented, antiquated APIs (and sometimes even a lack thereof)
Why you should join us
Opportunity to be a foundational team member to a well-funded, post-product and -revenue startup in a massive and largely untapped industry.
Hard backend engineering problems on day 1. Backend is all we do, and the projects you'll work on will be challenging and interesting.
Generous equity comp (90th+ percentile) and competitive cash comp (50th percentile). As we're a startup, we're happy to play with the balance for exceptional candidates.
The Founding Team

Our CEO is a strong engineer in his own right (Waterloo grad, senior eng at multiple Bay Area startups) but will be focusing on the business/product side. He’s gone super deep on insurance, including getting a Broker License and a stint as an Insurtech EIR at a top VC firm.

We’ve raised funding from great investors including top seed funds, ex-Plaid folks, and insurance industry insiders.

Description
Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

Multiple research opportunities are available in the Office of Translational Sciences (OTS)/ Office of Clinical Pharmacology (OCP), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) located in Silver Spring, Maryland. CDER performs an essential public health task by making sure that safe and effective drugs are available to improve the health of people in the United States. As part of the FDA, CDER regulates over-the-counter and prescription drugs, including biological therapeutics and generic drugs. This work covers more than just medicines.

The same drug given at the same dose can result in different clinical outcomes in different patients. All kinds of intrinsic and extrinsic factors can have an impact on the clinical outcome after treatment. This project will use machine learning to predict clinical outcomes based on baseline patient factors, and therefore help to find the right drug at the right dose for each patient.

Under the guidance of the mentor, the participant will learn regulatory framework, methodology, and approaches for drug evaluation. The participant will also learn methods and approaches for data analyses of clinical trials datasets.

This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and FDA. The initial appointment is for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of FDA contingent on the availability of funds. The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. The appointment is full-time at FDA in the Silver Spring, Maryland, area. Participants do not become employees of FDA, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits.

Completion of a successful background investigation by the Office of Personnel Management is required for an applicant to be on-boarded at FDA. OPM can complete a background investigation only for individuals, including non-US Citizens, who have resided in the US for a total of three of the past five years.

FDA Ethics Requirements If an ORISE Fellow, to include their spouse and minor children, reports what is identified as a Significantly Regulated Organization (SRO) or prohibited investment fund financial interest in any amount, or a relationship with an SRO, except for spousal employment with an SRO, and the individual will not voluntarily divest the financial interest or terminate the relationship, then the individual is not placed at FDA. For additional requirements, see FDA Ethics for Nonemployee Scientists.

FDA requires ORISE participants to read and sign their FDA Education and Training Agreement within 30 days of his/her start date, setting forth the conditions and expectations for his/her educational appointment at the agency. This agreement covers such topics as the following:

Non-employee nature of the ORISE appointment;
Prohibition on ORISE Fellows performing inherently governmental functions;
Obligation of ORISE Fellows to convey all necessary rights to the FDA regarding intellectual property conceived or first reduced to practice during their fellowship;
The fact that research materials and laboratory notebooks are the property of the FDA;
