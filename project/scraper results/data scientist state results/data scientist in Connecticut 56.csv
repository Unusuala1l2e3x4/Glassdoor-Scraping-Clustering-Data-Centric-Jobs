You will contribute to the training, testing, and deployment of deep learning models for species detection and identification in visual (camera trap, drone) and acoustic recordings.

Background

The Yale Center for Biodiversity and Global Change and its flagship Map of Life (MOL) project are advancing new technologies for the rapid documentation of local biodiversity. Map of Life delivers research and information about the distribution and conservation of biodiversity in a changing world to science, policy, business, local communities, and educators. Map of Life with Rapid Assessments takes the power of Map of Life to the local scale and combines it with novel survey technologies to deliver relevant local biodiversity insights.

Map of Life Rapid Assessments inventories local species communities with remotely operated visual and acoustic sensors in combination with expert knowledge and AI. Our teams deploy a fleet of drones in areas of high biodiversity richness and work to collect visual and acoustic samples within the environment. Our subsequent analysis then combines AI with human-in-the loop approaches to identify species. Our approach and team have now been selected as one of the six finalist teams in the XPRIZE Rainforest competition.

Within the processing pipeline, machine and deep learning play an important role and are used for selection and prioritization of recordings for further analysis. In this next phase we will scale up the development of new models and we are looking for a talented team member with experience in deep learning for computer vision or bioacoustics to assist with this effort.

Your primary task will consist of working with the MOL data science and machine learning staff to develop, assess, and refine models for species detection and identification in photos, videos, and acoustic recordings. Methodologies may include supervised fine-tuning, self-supervised pre-training, or active learning with expert input.

The position duration is 6-12 months for 20-40 hours per week. Long-term employment opportunities may be available following the initial appointment. A combination of remote and in-person work can be accommodated. Position available to start immediately.

Your profile

Candidates should bring:

● Excellent knowledge and experience in deep learning and software stacks (Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow/Jax).

● A BSc. or higher in Computer Science, Data Science, Statistics, or in Ecology, Conservation, Remote Sensing or a similar field.

The following skills are optional assets:

● Experience in multi-modal deep learning (visual, acoustic) and application of data science methods to real-world problems.

● Familiarity with cloud storage and relational databases (PostgreSQL, etc.) and programmatic access to both.

Application Instructions

We strongly encourage members of underrepresented groups in the sciences to apply. Historical and ongoing social inequities rooted in racism, sexism, ableism, and other forms of discrimination result in the continued and widespread exclusion of marginalized groups from academic spaces. At our Center, we strive to support individuals from diverse backgrounds and to create a safe and inclusive community to counter these legacies of discrimination within the ecological and environmental sciences. We are actively committed to building a team and community where individuals representing a variety of paths to the sciences are brought together to foster a community of learning and collaboration. We hope that our commitments and actions create a more supportive and inspiring environment for individuals and contribute to a more inclusive and equitable future for our field.

Our Client

We are a venture-backed startup building the infrastructure layer for Property & Casualty (P&C) insurance. Integrating technology in the insurance industry today is much like consumer finance pre-Plaid (we could succinctly be described as ""Plaid for Insurance""), or payments pre-Stripe, and our vision is to unlock a similar wave of innovation for the $2T global P&C industry.

Today, walking into an insurance agency is like stepping into a time machine. Filing cabinets, fax machines, piles of incoming and outgoing mail. What you don't see is that even for the parts that have been ""digitized"", needless manual work abounds. Few systems communicate directly, leading to endless copy-pasting from emails to various proprietary web portals/desktop apps and back again.

Carrier by carrier, endpoint by endpoint, we will bring each of those manual and error-prone workflows into our simple, modern API layer.

The implementation details are subject to change, but this is our north star, and the future we envision isn't possible without it.

What we're looking for

We are seeking a highly autonomous engineer (employee #2!) excited about owning the design and implementation of a robust, API-driven product and playing a foundational role in the formation of the company.

Responsibilities
You'll work closely with the team and early customers to build a world-class, API-driven product.
You'll solve hard technical problems from scratch, owning the solution through the entire development lifecycle.
You'll help define the tech stack/architecture for a fledgling product — we're technology agnostic and focus using the right tool for the job.
You'll contribute to the creation of the team culture, as well as internal tooling and processes.
Role requirements
4+ years professional backend/full-stack engineering experience. Working on large-scale open-source projects works too. You've played significant roles in either API design, building processing pipelines, or systemic integration of external systems.
Early-stage startup experience (or other similar unstructured, fast-paced environment)
Live in or willing to relocate to the Bay Area to work full-time in our SF office
Nice to haves
Experience with web scraping, email scraping, RPA — in general just getting data creatively out of hard-to-reach places
1+ years TypeScript/JavaScript experience in a professional or large-scale OSS setting. If you have a comprehensive side project you think is equivalent, send it our way! Clear, concise, and extensible code is important to us and collaborating with others is often a forcing function to that end.
Experience integrating with low tech industries, or other time spent integrating with poorly documented, antiquated APIs (and sometimes even a lack thereof)
Why you should join us
Opportunity to be a foundational team member to a well-funded, post-product and -revenue startup in a massive and largely untapped industry.
Hard backend engineering problems on day 1. Backend is all we do, and the projects you'll work on will be challenging and interesting.
Generous equity comp (90th+ percentile) and competitive cash comp (50th percentile). As we're a startup, we're happy to play with the balance for exceptional candidates.
The Founding Team

Our CEO is a strong engineer in his own right (Waterloo grad, senior eng at multiple Bay Area startups) but will be focusing on the business/product side. He’s gone super deep on insurance, including getting a Broker License and a stint as an Insurtech EIR at a top VC firm.

We’ve raised funding from great investors including top seed funds, ex-Plaid folks, and insurance industry insiders.

Salary Range: $160,000-$180,000 base.
