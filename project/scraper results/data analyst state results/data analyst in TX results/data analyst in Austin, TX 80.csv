The COR 22-033 LIDDA EDI Enhancements Project will develop an electronic data interface (EDI) between the LIDDA and the Long-Term Care Online Portal.

LIDDAs provide service coordination to individuals with IDD in the community and in some Medicaid waiver programs. Each LIDDA chooses their systems and software to complete assessments, develop services plans, and store documentation. There is not an electronic data interface (EDI) with the state’s LTC portal and LIDDA’s systems. As a result, service coordinators who enter information in the LIDDA’s system must manually enter the same information in the state’s LTC portal. Funds will be distributed in grants to LIDDAs to allow them to build an EDI with the LTC portal, gaining efficiencies as dual entry into multiple systems will no longer be necessary. State resources are allocated in an existing project to build the EDI in the state’s LTC portal. The development of an EDI will reduce manual work for service coordinators, creating efficiencies in their work processes and allowing staff more time to work directly with the clients they serve.

This project is complex and will require the knowledge, skills, and abilities of business analysts to work alongside existing program and contractor staff to successfully complete the project on time and within the budgeted funding. The Business Analyst II will be responsible for gathering, analyzing, and documenting requirements to fulfill the program’s business needs; serving as a liaison between IT and program staff and stakeholders to communicate the correct requirements needed to ensure a successful outcome; identifying and prioritizing the requirements to determine the best value to the agency; documenting and prioritizing the product backlog to ensure efficient use of resources; and managing operations team mobilization at project initiation and until demobilization for transition to operations. The program area does not currently have a staff resource with the requisite knowledge, skills, and abilities required of a Business Analyst II.

CANDIDATE SKILLS AND QUALIFICATIONS(Required):

Experience translating business needs into technical objectives and identifying solutions to satisfy the business need.
Experience reporting project status to management including risks, issues, and key decisions.
Experience identifying project risks and issues; and developing/implementing mitigation strategies.
Experience in effective general written/oral communication, including documenting requirements, deliverables, test scenarios and project status.
Experience utilizing business analysis skills and interacting with business end users and technical staff.
Experience performing review and approval processes of complex technical user and system requirements written by vendors.
Experience with Microsoft Office products (e.g., Word, Excel, etc.).

Starting in rural America. Today, 60 million Americans living in rural communities are facing a crisis of access to care. In the U.S. healthcare system, rural Americans experience significantly poorer clinical outcomes. This trend is rapidly accelerating as rural hospitals close and physician shortages increase, exacerbating health disparities. In fact, Americans living in rural communities suffer a mortality rate 23 percent higher than those in urban communities, in part because of the lack of access to quality care.

Our vision is care that enables everyone to achieve their best health. So, we're rearchitecting the way it's delivered – leveraging breakthroughs in diagnostics, remote monitoring, and a variety of other domains, Homeward is creating a new healthcare delivery model that is purpose-built for rural America and directly addresses the issues that have historically limited access and quality.

Most importantly, we're aligning everyone's incentives (ours, partner health plans', and members') towards getting and keeping people healthy by taking full responsibility and financial risk for the total cost of each member's healthcare and outcomes.

Homeward is co-founded by a leadership team that defined and delivered Livongo's products, and backed most recently by a $50 million series B co-led by Arch Ventures and Human Capital, with participation from General Catalyst for a total of $70 million in funding.

Collaborative spirit and ability to drive analyses with technical and non-technical stakeholders
Ability to zoom in with attention to detail and also zoom out to see the big picture
Strong communicator of questions, challenges, opportunities, and results to technical and non-technical audiences
