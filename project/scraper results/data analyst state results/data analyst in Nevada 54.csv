Job Description:
We are looking for passionate, experienced Marketing Analysts who are innovative problem solvers to join our marketing team in Henderson, Nevada.

Who We Are
In 2007, two pretty sharp brothers decided to bootstrap a new business venture using their poker winnings to fund it. A week before inception, one brother got a fox red Labrador retriever puppy and named him Red. He quickly became the center of their universe and the name Red Dog Media was officially born.
Today, Red Dog Media focuses on internet marketing; specifically performance marketing, search engine marketing, landing page optimization, and conversion rate optimization. What started with four employees has grown to over 50 people over the past 16 years.

Culture + Core Values
Our core values are woven throughout our entire interview process in order to gauge whether a candidate is a good cultural fit. There are several initiatives that keep the core values at the forefront of our culture. A few examples are: being discussed in 6 month reviews; our employee appreciation program; and being an integrated part of our company’s operating system.

Our Core Values:
Be Curious - Having a high level of engagement; Digging into problems; Not being satisfied with good enough; Being open to new ideas; Not being a know-it-all.

Be a Problem Solver - This is what separates the doers from the dreamers. It’s about executing and getting the important stuff done. A problem solver prioritizes, organizes, and simplifies. They are detail-oriented to make sure it's done right.

Be a Championship Teammate - While a ""team player"" is collegial, a champion teammate is much more. They have the drive to succeed, work hard, come prepared, hold themselves accountable to high standards, elevate those around them, and are coachable.

Be Better Than Yesterday - Do you bring more skills to the table today than a year ago? How do you plan to be better a year from now? We work in a fast-paced competitive industry. If we stagnate, we’ll get left behind. This applies at the company and personal level. Growth and improvement need not be only in technical skill sets; personal growth can be even more valuable. We embrace positive change and stretch ourselves to grow both personally and professionally.
