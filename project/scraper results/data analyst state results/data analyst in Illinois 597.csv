","Itasca, IL",$70K - $95K (Employer est.),5.0,"Thank you for taking time to stop by and take a look at the BA role I have posted on Indeed. If you have read my job descriptions before, welcome back. If you are new to my job descriptions, welcome to the party.

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tom Welke. I am Partner & Vp at RSM Solutions Inc and I have been recruiting technical talent for over 20 years (it was 20 in January) and been in the tech sector since the 1990s. Due to this, I am going to be far more focused on 'fit' than anything else...a fit for you and a fit for the client. I also like to add some humor to job descriptions as well (life is too short not to have some humor), so if you see something that makes you chuckle, that was the intent.

This role is for one of my best friends. Sometimes, when you work on a role, it takes another turn...where you want to not only do your best, but you want to exceed your own expectations...this is such a role. So, as you can imagine, I know the hiring manager for this role very very well. Here are some things that creates a good social fit:

This is a role where we need someone that doesn't need to be micro managed. The hiring manager for this role really enjoys working with people that think through their actions. If you are the kind of person that doesn't like to be micro-managed but can put their big boy pants or big girl pants on and gets their work done, this role will be GREAT for you.
No ego. Let me explain. If you think you are God's gift to IT and believe that the world revolves around you, then you should probably run for Congress (I hear they are hiring)...because you wont be a fit here.

However, we are seeking someone within driving distance to Itasca, Illinois or Hanover Park, Illinois.

Here is what we are seeking: We are seeking a JDE E1 BA that specializes in that wonderful and ever-exciting world of manufacturing. You will do all those key things that 'classic"" BA's are involved it...that being requirements gathering, documentation, process flow diagramming (I bet you are getting excited with every word), QA and deployment. If - oh joy of joys - you have combined some of those nifty PM and BA skills together, oh man that would be great. You will assist with trainingand technical support to system end-users as well. As you might have guessed, you will develop test plans and integrate technology into other business operations. Think of this role as a techno functional lead role responsible for providing input and assisting in the development and implementation of business initiatives to support company operations and business decision-making.

Here are some of the key things we are looking for (I am not going to tell you about an exhaustive list of a zillion things, half of which don't exist...so, I will slim this down to the real 'meat':

Real live, and in-depth JDE E1 experience in those nifty manufacturing modules.
Lead the IT Labware support & implementation process.
Experience with all those things that BA's know very very well...requirements gathering, documentation, process flow diagramming, QA and project deployments...with specific focus on JDE E1. that JDE experience is an absolute must have.
Experience writing SQL queries, data extracts, and V-Lookups.
Experience preparing test data to assist technical analyst to debug and troubleshoot issues
Experience analyzing, designing, and writing functional specifications based on business requirements (with focus on ERP).
Experience designing the following: Menus, UXone UDO – (like Watchlist, E1 Pages, Orchestrator solutions, Advanced queries), BIP Output, E1 Batch application, E1 Interactive Applications.
Experience performing unit and integration testing.
Experience working with Upgrade, Migration, Integration projects as required.

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tom Welke. I am Partner & Vp at RSM Solutions Inc and I have been recruiting technical talent for over 20 years (it was 20 in January) and been in the tech sector since the 1990s. Due to this, I am going to be far more focused on 'fit' than anything else...a fit for you and a fit for the client. I also like to add some humor to job descriptions as well (life is too short not to have some humor), so if you see something that makes you chuckle, that was the intent.

This role is for one of my best friends. Sometimes, when you work on a role, it takes another turn...where you want to not only do your best, but you want to exceed your own expectations...this is such a role. So, as you can imagine, I know the hiring manager for this role very very well. Here are some things that creates a good social fit:

This is a role where we need someone that doesn't need to be micro managed. The hiring manager for this role really enjoys working with people that think through their actions. If you are the kind of person that doesn't like to be micro-managed but can put their big boy pants or big girl pants on and gets their work done, this role will be GREAT for you.
No ego. Let me explain. If you think you are God's gift to IT and believe that the world revolves around you, then you should probably run for Congress (I hear they are hiring)...because you wont be a fit here.

If - oh joy of joys - you have combined some of those nifty PM and BA skills together, oh man that would be great. You will assist with trainingand technical support to system end-users as well. As you might have guessed, you will develop test plans and integrate technology into other business operations. Think of this role as a techno functional lead role responsible for providing input and assisting in the development and implementation of business initiatives to support company operations and business decision-making.

Here are some of the key things we are looking for (I am not going to tell you about an exhaustive list of a zillion things, half of which don't exist...so, I will slim this down to the real 'meat':

Real live, and in-depth JDE E1 experience in those nifty manufacturing modules.
Lead the IT Labware support & implementation process.
Experience with all those things that BA's know very very well...requirements gathering, documentation, process flow diagramming, QA and project deployments...with specific focus on JDE E1. that JDE experience is an absolute must have.
Experience writing SQL queries, data extracts, and V-Lookups.
Experience preparing test data to assist technical analyst to debug and troubleshoot issues
Experience analyzing, designing, and writing functional specifications based on business requirements (with focus on ERP).
Experience designing the following: Menus, UXone UDO – (like Watchlist, E1 Pages, Orchestrator solutions, Advanced queries), BIP Output, E1 Batch application, E1 Interactive Applications.

UL Urban Crime Lab

About the Department

Who We Are: In cities across the country, people face high rates of gun violence, under-resourced schools, and social harms associated with the criminal justice system - all of which disproportionately impact people of color. These inequalities have profound consequences on public safety and opportunity. As a society we have failed to address these challenges, in part, because of our lack of understanding of the most effective and cost-effective solutions that can have a real impact on people’s lives. We believe that rigorous research can help. The University of Chicago Crime Lab and Education Lab partner with cities and communities to use data and rigorous research to design, test, and scale programs and policies that enhance public safety, improve educational outcomes, and advance justice. Our mission is to combine world-class data science and research, in partnership with government agencies, to substantially improve the effectiveness of the public sector and achieve impact at scale.

Cocoa Climate Sustainability Data Analyst

Mars has set science-based targets to reduce the company’s greenhouses gases (GHG) emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) and to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Cocoa is the largest category within the business and plays a major role in enabling Mars to achieve the net zero target. Mars Cocoa Enterprise (MCE) has been implementing several activities that contribute to this goal and has been working to integrate this fully in business processes. This needs to be accompanied by enhanced, transparent, and accessible greenhouse gases (GHG) data analytics.

The Cocoa Climate Sustainability Data Analyst will play a global role to support the Cocoa Climate Sustainability team in developing, deploying, and generating MCE performance data analytics across key topics and KPIs relevant to the climate agenda and to other impact areas. This work ensures the link between the delivery or our sustainability objectives and our visibility of the performance results, strengthening business decision-making, ensuring data and information is actionable for business leaders, and enabling lower-footprint innovation through improved systems and tools. This role is responsible for interpreting complex sustainability data to support improved decision-making processes that will enable the efficient contribution of MCE to Mars net zero target.

Role responsibilities include global sustainability data analysis and reporting, farm-level polygon analysis and integration into Mars systems, impact factor methodology development and carbon footprint tool support. The role requires technical knowledge in a range of sustainability areas, including geographic information system (GIS), life cycle assessment with a core focus on climate, as well as strong capabilities in quantitative data analysis and modeling and systems integration. The ideal candidate will be a data-driven, adaptable, critical thinker who can maintain collaborative cross-functional relationships with other Mars teams, with suppliers and consultants.

What are we looking for?

Degree in business, engineering, data science or a sustainability-related topic.

Minimum 3 years’ experience working in a quantitative data analysis field or discipline, with focus on environmental sustainability, life cycle assessment and GHG accounting.

Experience across data analysis software and systems (SimaPro, Excel, Power BI, Python, etc.).

Geographic information system (GIS) expertise.

Technical knowledge across sustainability topics including GHG accounting and life cycle assessment.

Working understanding of GHG accounting standards and practices.

Strong critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Data storytelling skills.

Ability to work flexibly with global teams across different time zones.

Occasional travel may be required.

What will be your key responsibilities?

Data Analysis and Reporting

Lead the data analysis and scenario development for GHG accounting in MCE, adopting the full life cycle perspective that is needed in Scope 3 accounting and that is pertinent to MCE. Support tracking MCE climate-specific and other related sustainability performance to meet mainly internal and occasionally external reporting needs. This requires validating, collating and analyzing sustainability data across many continents to provide a comprehensive view of the MCE climate sustainability progress. This role is to engage with cross-functional stakeholders and will work to identify data gaps or issues to help work towards more streamlined and precise climate sustainability data management.

Farm-level Spatial Analysis

Lead farm-level spatial data analysis and integrate related outputs into Mars systems to reduce and report GHG emission reduction from achieving deforestation-free status, monitoring farm-level climate-smart practices and properly allocating emissions to cocoa. This requires, among others, ensuring polygon data received from our suppliers are complete and of high quality. This is to be in collaboration with other functions and with external service providers.

Impact Factor Development and Validation

Responsible for proposing new GHG impact factor methodologies and to help build a library of archetypes for supplier and origin-specific impact factor generation. These include generating impact factors specific to cocoa, considering different origins, agricultural practices, whilst considering carbon sinks and sources such as above and below ground carbon sequestration. This work entails drilling down on Life Cycle Assessment assumptions for cocoa in the World Food LCA Database and enhancing the data considering links between supply chain existing data and the overall impact factor estimates. This work is to be done in collaboration with Mars Inc. global sustainability team, and results are to be used for internal and external reporting.

Carbon Footprinting Tool Support

Support the development and use of a range of tools key for MCE’s ability to deliver on the climate goals over time, helping inform and shape choices and decisions, develop emissions scenarios and build on existing tools such as the Cool Farm Tool.

Making the links with other impact areas

This role will also leverage the existing and developing capabilities to deliver on climate targets to other impact areas, namely: land footprint, water stress and potentially also human rights targets.

We're doing this by making insurance fast, responsive, and focused on our high-growth and innovative customers. Instead of printed PDF applications and week-long waits, Vouch is building new technology to solve real problems, writing policies that actually cover relevant startup scenarios, and designing simple experiences in an otherwise frustrating industry.

What does a work environment look like at Vouch?

Vouch is a Virtual First Workplace with San Francisco, Chicago, and New York office locations.

Role Responsibilities:

Third-party reporting: Manage all external reporting requests (Fronting Carrier, Reinsurers, State DOIs), triage internal resources, and produce data submissions.
Insight reporting: Develop and manage underwriting Mode dashboards/reports. Provide Portfolio Underwriting Leads with various monthly insights that they can use in their decisions to improve Loss Ratio performance, Gross Written Premium growth, underwriting practice consistency, and underwriting efficiency. This includes claims trends or issues, inconsistent underwriting practices, lost business trends, and opportunities to drive more straight-through processing.
Claims analytics: Assist the Claims team with managing data collection, dashboard, and reporting needs. Apply statistical inference to insurance data to draw insights about claims, underwriting appetite, underwriting operations, and emerging risk trends.
Broadcasting underwriting metrics to the rest of Vouch by developing scalable analyses in collaboration with analysts across Vouch teams and adhering to Vouch analytics best practices.
Manage third-party relationships relating to external underwriting tools and resources.
Provide analytics capabilities to compliance and risk management committees to identify and mitigate company risks.
Create unorthodox analytical techniques to enhance underwriting efficiency.
Qualitative and quantitative research on competitor insurance innovations, risk trends, litigation trends, and applicability to Vouch’s underwriting.

About you:

4+ years in an analytical capacity as an actuarial analyst, data analyst, or underwriting assistant/analyst
Must have prior experience in P&C insurance with a deep understanding of commercial insurance products and the willingness to rapidly learn about new insurance developments
Strong data querying ability in SQL, including familiarity working with multiple CTEs and window functions

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tom Welke. I am Partner & Vp at RSM Solutions Inc and I have been recruiting technical talent for over 20 years (it was 20 in January) and been in the tech sector since the 1990s. Due to this, I am going to be far more focused on 'fit' than anything else...a fit for you and a fit for the client. I also like to add some humor to job descriptions as well (life is too short not to have some humor), so if you see something that makes you chuckle, that was the intent.

This role is for one of my best friends. Sometimes, when you work on a role, it takes another turn...where you want to not only do your best, but you want to exceed your own expectations...this is such a role. So, as you can imagine, I know the hiring manager for this role very very well. Here are some things that creates a good social fit:

This is a role where we need someone that doesn't need to be micro managed. The hiring manager for this role really enjoys working with people that think through their actions. If you are the kind of person that doesn't like to be micro-managed but can put their big boy pants or big girl pants on and gets their work done, this role will be GREAT for you.
No ego. Let me explain. If you think you are God's gift to IT and believe that the world revolves around you, then you should probably run for Congress (I hear they are hiring)...because you wont be a fit here.

However, we are seeking someone within driving distance to Itasca, Illinois or Hanover Park, Illinois.

Here is what we are seeking: We are seeking a JDE E1 BA that specializes in that wonderful and ever-exciting world of manufacturing. You will do all those key things that 'classic"" BA's are involved it...that being requirements gathering, documentation, process flow diagramming (I bet you are getting excited with every word), QA and deployment. If - oh joy of joys - you have combined some of those nifty PM and BA skills together, oh man that would be great. You will assist with trainingand technical support to system end-users as well. As you might have guessed, you will develop test plans and integrate technology into other business operations. Think of this role as a techno functional lead role responsible for providing input and assisting in the development and implementation of business initiatives to support company operations and business decision-making.

Here are some of the key things we are looking for (I am not going to tell you about an exhaustive list of a zillion things, half of which don't exist...so, I will slim this down to the real 'meat':

Real live, and in-depth JDE E1 experience in those nifty manufacturing modules.
Lead the IT Labware support & implementation process.
Experience with all those things that BA's know very very well...requirements gathering, documentation, process flow diagramming, QA and project deployments...with specific focus on JDE E1. that JDE experience is an absolute must have.
Experience writing SQL queries, data extracts, and V-Lookups.
Experience preparing test data to assist technical analyst to debug and troubleshoot issues
Experience analyzing, designing, and writing functional specifications based on business requirements (with focus on ERP).
Experience designing the following: Menus, UXone UDO – (like Watchlist, E1 Pages, Orchestrator solutions, Advanced queries), BIP Output, E1 Batch application, E1 Interactive Applications.
Experience performing unit and integration testing.
Experience working with Upgrade, Migration, Integration projects as required.

","Itasca, IL",$70K - $95K (Employer est.),5.0,"Thank you for taking time to stop by and take a look at the BA role I have posted on Indeed. If you have read my job descriptions before, welcome back. If you are new to my job descriptions, welcome to the party.

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tom Welke. I am Partner & Vp at RSM Solutions Inc and I have been recruiting technical talent for over 20 years (it was 20 in January) and been in the tech sector since the 1990s. Due to this, I am going to be far more focused on 'fit' than anything else...a fit for you and a fit for the client. I also like to add some humor to job descriptions as well (life is too short not to have some humor), so if you see something that makes you chuckle, that was the intent.

This role is for one of my best friends. Sometimes, when you work on a role, it takes another turn...where you want to not only do your best, but you want to exceed your own expectations...this is such a role. So, as you can imagine, I know the hiring manager for this role very very well. Here are some things that creates a good social fit:

This is a role where we need someone that doesn't need to be micro managed. The hiring manager for this role really enjoys working with people that think through their actions. If you are the kind of person that doesn't like to be micro-managed but can put their big boy pants or big girl pants on and gets their work done, this role will be GREAT for you.
No ego. Let me explain. If you think you are God's gift to IT and believe that the world revolves around you, then you should probably run for Congress (I hear they are hiring)...because you wont be a fit here.

However, we are seeking someone within driving distance to Itasca, Illinois or Hanover Park, Illinois.

Here is what we are seeking: We are seeking a JDE E1 BA that specializes in that wonderful and ever-exciting world of manufacturing. You will do all those key things that 'classic"" BA's are involved it...that being requirements gathering, documentation, process flow diagramming (I bet you are getting excited with every word), QA and deployment. If - oh joy of joys - you have combined some of those nifty PM and BA skills together, oh man that would be great. You will assist with trainingand technical support to system end-users as well. As you might have guessed, you will develop test plans and integrate technology into other business operations. Think of this role as a techno functional lead role responsible for providing input and assisting in the development and implementation of business initiatives to support company operations and business decision-making.

Here are some of the key things we are looking for (I am not going to tell you about an exhaustive list of a zillion things, half of which don't exist...so, I will slim this down to the real 'meat':

Real live, and in-depth JDE E1 experience in those nifty manufacturing modules.
Lead the IT Labware support & implementation process.
Experience with all those things that BA's know very very well...requirements gathering, documentation, process flow diagramming, QA and project deployments...with specific focus on JDE E1. that JDE experience is an absolute must have.
Experience writing SQL queries, data extracts, and V-Lookups.
Experience preparing test data to assist technical analyst to debug and troubleshoot issues
Experience analyzing, designing, and writing functional specifications based on business requirements (with focus on ERP).
Experience designing the following: Menus, UXone UDO – (like Watchlist, E1 Pages, Orchestrator solutions, Advanced queries), BIP Output, E1 Batch application, E1 Interactive Applications.

","Chicago, IL",$88K - $124K (Glassdoor est.),4.1,"What You’ll Do at BTS

The greatest ideas in the world will die on the vine if not properly implemented. At BTS, we turn our clients’ ideas and strategies into results. We do this by designing customized experiences that drive innovation, alignment, and performance.

As a Business Analyst consultant on the Strategy & Business Modeling team, you’ll work directly with leaders from the world’s leading corporations. You’ll learn their strategies and how their businesses work, and you’ll be shaping the leadership capabilities of their senior management. A BTS consultant also cultivates the skills of thousands of developing leaders across the globe.

A Strategy & Business Modeler (SBMer) is responsible for designing and building the business simulations and models that are the foundation of many BTS experiences. Our excel-based models help leaders at organizations visualize their role in their company’s strategy and understand how their decisions impact organizational performance.

The SBMer is a key member of the BTS consultant team that conducts discovery interviews with client stakeholders, co-creates a design with the client to deliver on their objectives, builds the modeling component of the experience, and delivers, facilitates, and presents the end solution to the client. An SBMer brings specialized knowledge to the BTS team by helping to simplify complex business models, highlighting tradeoffs within the client’s business, and bringing strong business and financial expertise to the team. The SBMer is also expected to be a trusted advisor to the client by co-leading interviews and milestone meetings as well as joining client facilitation teams. ,

There are no industry verticals at BTS, and you will have all the variety you want in your clients and work. You’ll be staffed on multiple projects at one time, across different industries, and with different internal teams.

We feel that regularly working together in the office is the best situation for career development, and so we are not hiring remotely-based employees at this time. However, we have a hybrid work environment where you can work from home a few days a week. As for travel, we do that when we are in front of our clients leading them through BTS experiences and workshops we’ve created. And as we continue getting back to “normal,” you can expect that you’ll travel around 25-30% of the time, going to different cities to facilitate the incredible experiences you’ve designed.

What We’re Looking For

Curiosity. Resourcefulness. A humble and inclusive spirit. These are core attributes of BTS all-stars.

Strong business and financial acumen and a love for problem solving with a structured approach to scoping solutions to those problems. Advanced Excel skills (INDEX/MATCH, Lookups, IF statements) are a must. Modeling skills, as well as experience with programming languages, especially VBA, are big pluses. Backgrounds in engineering, finance, science, math, or economics are well-suited. We have team members from all kinds of backgrounds, work experience, and education. We love diversity and variety.

We do have a few requirements. Bachelor’s degree or equivalent experience is needed, as are strong written and verbal communication skills. Willingness to travel as indicated above.

Lastly, we require eligibility to work in the US permanently without sponsorship.

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tom Welke. I am Partner & Vp at RSM Solutions Inc and I have been recruiting technical talent for over 20 years (it was 20 in January) and been in the tech sector since the 1990s. Due to this, I am going to be far more focused on 'fit' than anything else...a fit for you and a fit for the client. I also like to add some humor to job descriptions as well (life is too short not to have some humor), so if you see something that makes you chuckle, that was the intent.

This role is for one of my best friends. Sometimes, when you work on a role, it takes another turn...where you want to not only do your best, but you want to exceed your own expectations...this is such a role. So, as you can imagine, I know the hiring manager for this role very very well. Here are some things that creates a good social fit:

This is a role where we need someone that doesn't need to be micro managed. The hiring manager for this role really enjoys working with people that think through their actions. If you are the kind of person that doesn't like to be micro-managed but can put their big boy pants or big girl pants on and gets their work done, this role will be GREAT for you.
No ego. Let me explain. If you think you are God's gift to IT and believe that the world revolves around you, then you should probably run for Congress (I hear they are hiring)...because you wont be a fit here.

However, we are seeking someone within driving distance to Itasca, Illinois or Hanover Park, Illinois.

Here is what we are seeking: We are seeking a JDE E1 BA that specializes in that wonderful and ever-exciting world of manufacturing. You will do all those key things that 'classic"" BA's are involved it...that being requirements gathering, documentation, process flow diagramming (I bet you are getting excited with every word), QA and deployment. If - oh joy of joys - you have combined some of those nifty PM and BA skills together, oh man that would be great. You will assist with trainingand technical support to system end-users as well. As you might have guessed, you will develop test plans and integrate technology into other business operations. Think of this role as a techno functional lead role responsible for providing input and assisting in the development and implementation of business initiatives to support company operations and business decision-making.

Here are some of the key things we are looking for (I am not going to tell you about an exhaustive list of a zillion things, half of which don't exist...so, I will slim this down to the real 'meat':

Real live, and in-depth JDE E1 experience in those nifty manufacturing modules.
Lead the IT Labware support & implementation process.
Experience with all those things that BA's know very very well...requirements gathering, documentation, process flow diagramming, QA and project deployments...with specific focus on JDE E1. that JDE experience is an absolute must have.
Experience writing SQL queries, data extracts, and V-Lookups.
Experience preparing test data to assist technical analyst to debug and troubleshoot issues
Experience analyzing, designing, and writing functional specifications based on business requirements (with focus on ERP).
Experience designing the following: Menus, UXone UDO – (like Watchlist, E1 Pages, Orchestrator solutions, Advanced queries), BIP Output, E1 Batch application, E1 Interactive Applications.
Experience performing unit and integration testing.
Experience working with Upgrade, Migration, Integration projects as required.
Experience with AS IS Analysis, Mapping of JDE within existing systems, creating setups, User Training, Testing (unit and Integration), giving solutions to the client issues, data loading, Creating Menus Versions, Defining setups, Integration with other modules, preparation, and finalization of specs for report, documentation of the Business Processes, Setups, and User Manuals.
