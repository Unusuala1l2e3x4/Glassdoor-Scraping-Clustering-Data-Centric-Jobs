Media & Data Visualization Analyst,"Applecart
","New York, NY",$70K - $85K (Employer est.),4.8,"Applecart was founded in recognition of a challenge: the most influential individuals – executives, investors, policymakers – have historically been the most difficult to access. Large organizations have often spent hundreds of millions of dollars to reach a handful of these people. Applecart's technology is designed to level the playing field.

Applecart is the leading technology platform creating a new category of ""Decision Maker Marketing"". From enterprise sales and corporate communications to government relations and employee engagement, the most sophisticated C-suite leaders use Applecart to manage their brand with business-critical decision makers such as policymakers, investors, CEOs, key employees, members of the media and more.

Traditional digital targeting technology can help organizations reach a mass audience, but it doesn't really move the needle on critical outcomes. Decision makers are informed by what they read, learn from advisors, hear from colleagues, and discuss with family and friends. To break through to them, you must reach them through the only channel that really moves them: those they know and trust. Applecart's platform uses publicly available or fully permissioned data to map billions of social relationships between nearly every American adult. By making this data addressable in a privacy compliant way, Applecart enables clients to market directly to decision makers and those that matter most to them.

A few quick facts about us:

Applecart's platform has been used by hundreds of industry-leading clients spanning Fortune 500 companies like Blackstone and Intuit, leading nonprofit organizations like the Environmental Defense Fund, and top-tier communications and public affairs firms like Teneo, Sard Verbinnen, and Weber Shandwick.
Applecart is growing quickly—over the last several years we've averaged 122% revenue growth year-over-year.
Our senior leadership team includes two members of the 2021 Forbes 30 under 30 list for Marketing and Advertising, the former Head of Product at Moat, Oracle's online ad measurement platform, a former senior White House advisor, an early sales leader at Google and Twitter, and two of the Democratic Party's most successful pollsters and strategists.
Our investors include global sports, entertainment and marketing giant Endeavor, KKR Co-Founder Henry Kravis, entrepreneur Chris Burch, a founder of Palantir, senior engineering leaders at Twitter and Yelp, former Fortune 50 and advertising agency CEOs, and a number of well-known venture capitalists. Endeavor CEO Ari Emanuel and Owl Capital Managing Partner Jennifer Fonstad serve on our board.
Our work has been featured on Morning Joe on MSNBC, Bloomberg and The Colbert Report, and in Axios, BusinessWeek, the Associated Press, Forbes, the Washington Post, and Politico, among many others.

Over the course of the next five years, COMPASS will allow our faculty and administration to establish a new First-Year Experience for all freshmen and rebuild our General Education curriculum to foster student engagement, expand student support, and help our students cultivate a sense of belonging at Mercy. Program objectives include: (1) In each year of the grant beginning in Year 2, at least 80 percent of first-time full-time students, including Hispanic or low-income students, will pass the First Year Seminar course with a grade of C or better; (2) In each year of the grant beginning in Year 2 at least 75 percent of first-time, full-time students, including Hispanic or low-income students, who are enrolled in FYS will retain to the next year with a GPA of at least 2.0; and (3) By the end of Year 5, at least 50 percent of the Hispanic or low-income students who participate in COMPASS will graduate from Mercy College with a bachelor’s degree within six years.

The GRAD-PRO project involves the cooperation and collaboration of all Schools at Mercy University. The objectives include: (1) Expand postbaccalaureate educational opportunities for, and improve the academic attainment of, Hispanic students; (2) Provide an enhanced focus of academic and career alignment; (3) Expand and support a culture of faculty mentorship with personalized interactions between faculty and students; (4) Bolster student retention, persistence, and degree attainment by providing supplementary resources, including scholarships, to offset the cost of educational expenses.

10101 - Quantitative Data Analyst,"The Fund for Public Health in New York City
","New York, NY",$60K - $75K (Employer est.),3.5,"Quantitative Data Analyst

The Fund for Public Health in New York City (FPHNYC) is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization dedicated to advancing the health and well-being of all New Yorkers. To this end, in partnership with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), FPHNYC incubates innovative public health initiatives implemented by DOHMH to advance community health throughout the city. It facilitates partnerships, often new and unconventional, between the government and the private sector to develop, test, and launch new initiatives. These collaborations speed the execution of demonstration projects, effect expansion of successful pilot programs, and support rapid implementation to meet the public health needs of individuals, families, and communities across New York City.

PROGRAM OVERVIEW
The Health Department is working to ensure fair and equitable access to the COVID-19 vaccine. This requires that the communities hit hardest by the pandemic have access to the vaccine and Vaccine Hubs operated by the Health Department throughout the city. The Health Department’s COVID-19 Equity Action Plan recognizes that underinvestment and structural racism are the root causes of the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths seen in priority neighborhoods.
The COVID-19 Housing Recovery program at NYCHA (VEPE 4) will support equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine information by funding community partners to develop messaging, lead engagement, and support navigation of vaccination scheduling systems in priority communities. Community and faith-based organizations often rely on very limited internal resources stretched even thinner by COVID-19 and parallel pandemics (e.g., mental health, chronic disease, social and economic instability, and racism). The funding aims to increase investment in organizations that have deep roots in the priority communities we seek to engage.
This position is funded for 1 year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021, P.L. 116-260. The office is at 42-09 28th Street, Long Island City. NY.

POSITION OVERVIEW
The Quantitative Data Analyst will support the development and management of data collection tools used with community-based and faith-based partners under the supervision of the Assistant Director of Evaluation. In alignment with all CDC guidelines and requirements, the analyst will implement a cohesive quantitative data analytic strategy and support reporting to document the VEPE 4 grant program’s progress. The analysis will be based on equity principles and critical race praxis, leveraging data instruments and models such as the NYC Community Health Survey, COVID-19 surveillance data, and the CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index to inform operational planning and engagement strategies.

RESPONSIBILITIES

Respond quickly to relevant data requests from key stakeholders and leadership.
Support coordination and submission of all necessary reporting requirements to the CDC.
Support administrative functions within the data team, including taking meeting notes, compiling action items, and ensuring appropriate tracking and follow-up.

The Fund for Public Health in New York City (FPHNYC) is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that is dedicated to the advancement of the health and well-being of all New Yorkers. To this end, in partnership with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), FPHNYC incubates innovative public health initiatives implemented by DOHMH to advance community health throughout the city. It facilitates partnerships, often new and unconventional, between government and the private sector to develop, test, and launch new initiatives. These collaborations speed the execution of demonstration projects, effect expansion of successful pilot programs, and support rapid implementation to meet the public health needs of individuals, families, and communities across New York City.

PROGRAM OVERVIEW (Division of Disease Control)
Established in 1805, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) is the oldest and largest health department in the country. DOHMH strives to protect and promote the health of all New Yorkers. With a vision to be a city where all New Yorkers can realize their full health potential, regardless of who they are, where they are from or where they live, our core values are science, equity, and compassion.

A world-renowned public health agency responding to urgent public health crises from New York City’s yellow fever outbreak in 1822, to the COVID-19 pandemic, DOHMH has been a hub for public health innovation, expertise, and resource. From food policy, tobacco, HIV/AIDS, family child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial justice work, DOHMH’s impact to public policy across the nation has been vast.

Our 7,000-plus team members bring extraordinary diversity to the work of public health. True to our value of equity, DOHMH has been a leader in recognizing and dismantling the impact of racism on the health of New Yorkers and more broadly. In 2021, the New York City Board of Health declared racism as a public health crisis. With commitment to dismantle systems that perpetuate inequitable power, opportunity, and access, DOHMH continues to work in and with communities with historic disinvestment and disease burden to decrease unfair and avoidable health outcomes so all New Yorkers can achieve their full health potential.

Job Description
The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) is the City agency responsible for regulating for-hire transportation in New York City, including taxis and for-hire vehicles such as Uber and Lyft. TLC licenses about 175,000 drivers, 115,000 vehicles, and 1,000 businesses, which together transport about a million passengers a day, making TLC the most active for-hire transportation regulatory agency in the world with oversight of a key component of the city’s transportation network.

We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.

Our Agency’s five strategic priorities, building off a recently-completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are:

In 2021, the NYC Board of Health declared racism as a public health crisis. With commitment to advance anti-racist public health practices that dismantle systems that perpetuate inequitable power, opportunity and access, the NYC Health Department continues to work in and with communities and community organizations to increase their access to health services and decrease avoidable health outcomes.

Job Description
Established in 1805, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (the NYC Health Department) is the oldest and largest health department in the country. Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all New Yorkers, in service of a vision of a city in which all New Yorkers can realize their full health potential, regardless of who they are, how old they are, where they are from, or where they live.

As a world-renowned public health agency with a history of building transformative public health programming and infrastructure, innovating in science and scholarship to advance public health knowledge, and responding to urgent public health crises from New York City’s yellow fever outbreak in 1822, to the COVID-19 pandemic we are a hub for public health innovation, expertise, and programs, and services. We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.

Our Agency’s five strategic priorities, building off a recently-completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are:
1) To re-envision how the Health Department prepares for and responds to health emergencies, with a focus on building a “response-ready” organization, with faster decision-making, transparent public communications, and stronger surveillance and bridges to healthcare systems 2) Address and prevent chronic and diet-related disease, including addressing rising rates of childhood obesity and the impact of diabetes, and transforming our food systems to improve nutrition and enhance access to healthy foods
3) Address the second pandemic of mental illness including: reducing overdose deaths, strengthening our youth mental health systems, and supporting people with serious mental illness
4) Reduce black maternal mortality and make New York a model city for women’s health
5) Mobilize against and combat the health impacts of climate change

Our 7,000-plus team members bring extraordinary diversity to the work of public health. True to our value of equity as a foundational element of all of our work, and a critical foundation to achieving population health impact in New York City, the NYC Health Department has been a leader in recognizing and dismantling racism’s impacts on the health of New Yorkers and beyond. In 2021, the NYC Board of Health declared racism as a public health crisis. With commitment to advance anti-racist public health practices that dismantle systems that perpetuate inequitable power, opportunity and access, the NYC Health Department continues to work in and with communities and community organizations to increase their access to health services and decrease avoidable health outcomes.
