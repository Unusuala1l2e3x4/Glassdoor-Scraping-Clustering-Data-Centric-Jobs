As a senior performance measures analyst, you will support, develop, improve, and administer performance measures programs and processes to enable the HR Shared Services space.

As a senior performance measures analyst in HR Shared Services, you will…


Develop reports and dashboards – You will be responsible for understanding the needs of the business and customers and creating reports and dashboards consumable by broad audiences in ServiceNow. You’ll also lay the foundation for further reporting mechanisms outside of the tool, such as via Tableau and text analytics. This will require cross-functional collaboration with Starbucks Technology and Data Analytics teams.
Assess and analyze data – You’ll continuously analyze the data being used across the business, and proactively improve and adjust to ensure reports and data provided meet business needs. You’ll support data analysis for your customers, and build the analytical muscle of the organization, providing supporting documentation and training to ensure data is leveraged effectively.
Support tool and system oversight – In partnership with your team, you’ll assess the needs of the business, gather requirements, independently identify process improvements, test system enhancements, and troubleshoot, with the goal of reducing friction, improving the employee and user experience, and driving self-service usage and contact reduction.
Consult with customers and convey technical information – You’ll be looked to as the HR ServiceNow analytics subject matter expert across multiple teams. You will be responsible for consulting with business customers on solutions or recommendations, conveying technical information in an easy to understand manner, and occasionally presenting out data driven narratives in cross-functional meetings with multiple stakeholders. This will require a keen ability to prioritize multiple deliverables across a large customer base.

Opportunity to enroll in state retirement programs and a deferred compensation plan.
A minimum of 14 days of vacation leave per year and 12 paid holidays throughout the calendar year.
OFM offers a commute trip reduction program, tuition reimbursement, membership to statewide Business Resource Groups and an Infants-at-Work program.
