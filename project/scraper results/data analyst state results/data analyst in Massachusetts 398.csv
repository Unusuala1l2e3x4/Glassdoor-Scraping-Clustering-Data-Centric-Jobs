Below is some information from WellSense leadership regarding what they are looking for now:

Having contact center experience and background is critical. Contact center is a very unique beast compared to regular projects. So having that knowledge is critical. The core technology (Genesy, Avaya, RingCentral) etc. is not relevant. RingCentral and Pete's team have the technical infrastructure piece covered. Ultimately all these platforms are very similar. We need a BA to work closely with both our business groups to map out the current state and more importantly the future state. This will also require clearly mapping out the RingCentral features and which ones are relevant to our business and how we plan to use them.

","Cambridge, MA",$102K - $136K (Glassdoor est.),3.7,"Who We Are

NewGlobe supports visionary governments to transform public education systems, the cornerstone of a prosperous, equitable, and peaceful society.

With a comprehensive system transformation platform and data-driven educational services, NewGlobe delivers rapid and dramatic improvements in learning outcomes at state and nationwide scale. Through building impactful partnerships and programmes, NewGlobe ensures that all children have access to an education that will develop their full potential and create a foundation for growth and prosperity.

NewGlobe leverages more than a decade of educational experience and proven impact in integrated school management, teacher professional development, instructional design innovation, technological system support, child-centered classroom practice, and parent engagement - all grounded in learning science - to ensure each teacher is empowered to engage children in transformational learning, and all children have the opportunity to develop to their full potential. Every day, NewGlobe supports governments to solve what were once seen as intractable problems, and by doing so, ensures this generation will be able to grow up to lead more fulfilled lives, while simultaneously building economic prosperity for themselves, their communities, and the globe.

NewGlobe's high-touch, intensive professional development programs, along with integrated school management, teacher support, and assessment software, enable schools to succeed. NewGlobe works within state and national curriculum and syllabi, ensuring all children are empowered to learn their own history, and master local content, while being globally competitive in mathematics and languages. The science of behaviour change and the science of learning is at the foundation of all programming.

NewGlobe works with urgency because youth quickly becomes adulthood and relentlessly because improvement requires continuous problem-solving. NewGlobe is honoured to serve and to help rebuild trust in public systems.

NewGlobe's work is all encompassing and will challenge you to use your full mind, and heart, each day. We need bright minds who want to be part of building a new globe - a more equitable globe - to join us.

Academics

The objective of the Academics group is to drive student achievement. To do so, we must know what is happening minute-by-minute for the typical child. The student's daily experience, and thus the path to achievement, emerges from their relationship with the teachers and the content that is delivered in the classroom. Our team is collaboratively organized around these levers. We develop rigorous content pitched at the right level for students to be delivered by a teacher who is prepared to succeed in the classroom. Our Instructional Design department builds the content; our Leadership & Development department trains teachers and school leaders using scientifically-proven techniques; our Learning Innovation department looks at cutting-edge research to generate breakthrough learning gains. Underpinning all of this is the work of the independent Measurement and Evaluation group, which provides Academics with an empirical orientation toward improving that daily experience and, in turn, driving achievement.

Measurement & Evaluation

The Measurement & Evaluation team at NewGlobe is housed within the Academics group and collaborates across departments to help leaders assess the quality of teaching and learning at NewGlobe. We work to answer the core questions of ""How well are we doing?"", ""Are we getting better?"", and ""How can we get even better?"". We blend quantitative analyses with qualitative field work to measure what matters most, provide feedback to NewGlobe school leaders and managers, assess our impact on student learning, and communicate the results to various internal and external audiences.

At the heart of our work is comparative analysis. We compare student learning at NewGlobe across time and place. In all of our locations, we examine how much faster NewGlobe students learn than their peers in similar schools. We examine how student performance today compares to student performance yesterday. We examine sub-groups of students to advance equity. We examine variability across our schools to determine which characteristics matter most to student learning. We help NewGlobe managers assess the impact of the changes they have made to accelerate learning.

We take pride in providing rigorous measurement, study design, and analysis. We also take pride in our ability to communicate clearly in words, tables, and data visualizations. We intend our work to make a difference in how NewGlobe managers and our government partners think and act. We judge our own work accordingly.

Collaboration sits at the heart of M&E at NewGlobe. We collaborate with our internal team members as well as with our government partners. With every product, we enter into a collaborative conversation with those who operate and those who study. M&E has established deep partnerships with the education ministries, with local research organizations, and with international researchers who focus on teaching and learning, especially those who focus on the aspects of schooling most relevant to the students we serve.

About the Role

We are seeking a full-time M&E Data Analyst to join our team. We are looking for someone eager to conduct impactful research, share their expertise, and build upon a tradition of evaluation and data excellence at NewGlobe.

The Data Analyst is responsible for supporting the data analysis of different descriptive analyses and impact evaluations within the organization. These analyses can range from simple descriptive analyses using a few Excel formulas, to more complex work using multiple Stata or R scripts. To do this, the Analyst will need to manage all parts of the data analysis process - starting from the design stage through the execution of analyses, and the reporting of the findings to other internal stakeholders.

The analyst is responsible for the provision of high-quality data products that other colleagues can rely on, and build their own work on. As such, this role is at the core of a large portion of all the M&E efforts within NewGlobe, and in consequence, at the intersection of our evaluation efforts to continually deliver stronger education to our students. We view data and analytics as core to our ability to learn as an organization. We want to cultivate data and analytics rock stars, people who produce and use data to reveal actionable insights for NewGlobe's rapidly growing network of schools. The person in this role will receive constant coaching and mentoring from the rest of the M&E and Data Analytics team, and professional development will be a core feature of this role.

The M&E Analyst should be willing to work in Cambridge, MA. The M&E Analyst will report to the Director, M&E. Significant travel is required.

What You Will Do
Clean and analyze data sets. These data sets can be used to answer questions from a wide range of topics like academic performance, impact evaluation studies, internal RCTs, among others.
Ensure the creation of proper data pipelines and best data management practices.
Contribute to a culture of data-driven decision-making by collaborating with various team members across territories.
Accommodate requests for quick analyses. Time-sensitive questions will come from the VPs and C-Level Executives, and usually take anywhere from a few hours to a few days. Oftentimes, you will need to direct your staff to use their best judgment in the face of imperfect data.
Other duties as required by the Directors and VP of M&E, and C-level executives.
What You Should Have
High data literacy and a strong background in econometrics and/or statistics. Previous experience in an academic or applied setting, such as being an analyst, research assistant, data manager, or consultant. Experience in data cleaning, analysis, and/or visualization.
A high level of proficiency with Stata or R, and Excel. Any other data analysis software or coding language is a plus. Experience with survey software like Qualtrics, SurveyCTO, or Google Forms is also a plus.
Undergraduate degree (or its equivalent) or Masters degree – in a relevant academic discipline, for example (but not limited to) Economics, Public or Education Policy, or Statistics.
Strong communication skills and the ability to translate complex ideas for non-technical audiences – you will need effective verbal and written communication skills to provide valuable insights and research reports for internal and external stakeholders.
Belief in data-driven decision making.
Flexible and loves to work in a dynamic environment.
Passion – for NewGlobe's mission.
Bonus – experience in extreme growth situations and dealing with complexity; worked/studied in a developing country, worked in a no-excuses charter school in high-poverty areas in the U.S., and/or experience implementing data collection projects, particularly for impact evaluations.
You're also
A detailed doer – You have a track record of getting things done. You're organized and responsive. You take ownership of every idea you touch and execute it to a fine level of detail, setting targets, engaging others, and doing whatever it takes to get the job done. You can multi-task dozens of such projects at once and never lose sight of the details. Likely, you have some experience in a start-up or other rapid-growth company.
A networking mastermind – You excel at meeting new people and turning them into advocates. You communicate in a clear, conscientious, and effective way in both written and oral speech. You can influence strangers in the course of a single conversation. Allies and colleagues will go to bat for your ideas. You have an existing network from prior experience in the country, preferably in the regulatory, education, or business sectors.
A creative problem-solver – Growing any business from scratch comes with massive and constant challenges. On top of that, NewGlobe works in often fragile, sometimes volatile low-resource communities and with complex government systems. You need to be flexible and ready to get everything done effectively, quickly, and affordably with the materials at hand.
A relentless advocate –The children we serve and teachers we empower never leave your mind. You know them, get them, have shared a meal with them (or would be happy to in the future). You would never shrink back from shaking a parent's hand or picking up a crying child, no matter what the person was wearing or looked like. Every decision you make considers their benefit, experience,
and value.
A malleable learner –You believe you can always do better. You welcome constructive criticism and provide it freely to others. You know you only get better tomorrow when others point out where you've missed things or failed today.
A curious investigator – You ask why a lot. You don't just take what you see and accept it. You wonder why it is that way, and are aware that the world we see is created by human choices and actions – and it could be different. You wonder, and see the world as wonderful even when you want to change a part of it that is unjust.",2007,Education & Training Services,Unknown / Non-Applicable,Education,1001 to 5000 Employees,Company - Private,True

Research Associate/Data Analyst
Job Description Summary
Admin Non-Exempt
Job Description
The Research Associate/Data Analyst will primarily provide analytical support to the Director of the Youth, Media, and Wellbeing Research Lab (YMW) at the Wellesley Centers for Women (WCW), Wellesley College. Our research involves quantitative and qualitative studies of adolescent and young adult social media and televised media use, socioemotional health, physical health, peer and romantic relationships, digital citizenship, election attitudes, and civic engagement. We are committed to an intersectional identity approach, exploring questions of race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, class, etc. We use a variety of methods to collect data in schools and community organizations, as well as through online platforms. We collect surveys, conduct interviews and focus groups, and social media content data of adolescents and young adults. Since 2013, we have collected multiple waves of cross-sectional survey data from over 25 countries related to gender equity and election attitudes from over 5000 individuals. Our recent NIH grant about adolescent social technology use amassed 5 waves of survey data from over 1500 middle and high school students in the Northeast. Locally, we also evaluate a summer workshop each year with approximately 25 youth using pre-/post-surveys. Another line of research that our lab conducts is the role of pets in adolescent development and technology use, which is a collaboration with Tufts University Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine.
The Research Data Analyst works collaboratively with our Project Coordinator, YMW Research Lab members, and with a doctoral-level statistical consultant, under the general direction of the Director. This RA’s primary role will be as the lab’s Quantitative Data Manager, which will involve co-developing recruitment and data collection procedures; creating, launching, and pilot testing Qualtrics surveys; data management (e.g., cleaning, confidential storage and documentation of identifiable data); and mentoring Wellesley College students on a variety of data analysis projects. Our quantitative data analysis will involve cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys, the latter which will require careful matching of participants from wave to wave. Data analysis may include recoding of variables, conducting reliability and validity statistics of study measures, quantifying qualitative data, and visualizing findings for academic presentations. The Data Analyst will maintain a library of relevant measures for past, current, and future studies. For grant proposals and funder reporting, the Data Analyst will prepare and summarize preliminary findings for the specific topic, including charts and tables depicting key highlights/insights using SPSS, Excel, Tableau, or similar programs. For manuscripts, the Data Analyst will draft and revise the Methods and Results section as needed.
In addition to the data analysis, the Research Associate will also provide administrative, logistical, and technical support as needed. Depending on the prior experiences and expertise of the candidate, these tasks may include collaborating with the Project Coordinator, Communications, and Technology teams to assist with quantitative and qualitative data collection, generating study content for website, creating infographics for the lab and WCW social media accounts, copyediting/formatting of manuscripts into the journal style (e.g., APA, AMA), and/or assisting with Institutional Review Board applications. Opportunities to publish in peer-reviewed journals and present at local and national conferences are available. Because this is a liberal arts teaching/learning lab, the data analyst will also work with multiple Wellesley College student research assistants.
This position is a grant-funded, 60% (21.0 hours/week) position with full benefits. Desired schedule would be part-time 3-4 days a week to be negotiated between 9-6pm. This is a term position for 3 years but may be extended beyond that date.

Excellent interpersonal skills, patience, and openness to constructive feedback
Good written communication skills (e.g., email correspondence, academic writing) and careful attention to detail

The department provides the company with information to assess whether or not a claim has third party recovery potential while ensuring that all claim information supplied to attorneys, adjusters, and members is accurate.

In addition to helping hard working employees and their families access high quality, affordable health care, while enjoying unrivaled benefits for yourself, you will also enjoy being part of a team that has been recognized by The Boston Globe as a Top Place to Work. In its 14th annual employee-based survey, The Boston Globe determined that The Phia Group is one of the most rewarding, admired and meaningful employment experiences in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as voted upon by the people who know them best – their employees.

Note: This is an onsite position, but we can provide a flexible teleworking schedule if appropriate.

In addition, the BHE’s authority includes administering state financial aid, managing and responding to consumer complaints, conducting financial assessments of institutions, and approving degree-granting authority for all public and most private higher education institutions operating within the Commonwealth.

About the Role

The Analyst and Medical Writer positions are ideal for recent graduates in the sciences, and those with experience in scientific research, who are seeking the opportunity to apply their knowledge to real-world projects. Analysts and Medical Writers work on projects involving the detailed analysis of data from clinical trials and the assimilation and creative presentation of this analysis in different formats including posters, slide sets, value dossiers, reports and peer-reviewed publications. These deliverables are used directly by our clients in communication with external stakeholders, which are instrumental to the successful uptake of novel therapies. The work is structured on a project-by-project basis and you will be working on three or four projects at any one time across a range of high-profile disease areas and products, presenting variety of work and the opportunity to develop a wide skill set.

You will work in project teams alongside experienced colleagues who will provide training on the technical aspects of the role as well as project management and effective client communication. Delivering project work requires close collaboration with clients, and following a successful induction period you will increasingly participate in teleconferences and face-to-face client meetings. The latter may present opportunities for travel within the US and internationally.

You will be based in our office in Boston, which was established in 2020. This presents opportunities to shape and drive our US company; an endeavor supported by the success of our existing operations in the UK and Asia. You will work closely with our Scientific Director, who is based in Boston and has more than 10 years of experience in the industry, and other senior colleagues in the US and globally.

Costello Medical is structured into divisional teams focusing on distinct services within the healthcare industry. Our Boston office is structured around three teams who focus on Medical Communications, Evidence Development and Market Access. Upon joining Costello Medical, you will join one of these teams but will also have the opportunity to work on projects in other areas. Please note that you will be asked to specify which team you are applying for in your application form.

Medical Communications – Medical Writer

Medical Communications at Costello Medical encompasses both publications and medical affairs projects, with Medical Writers having the opportunity to work across these types of projects or specialize in one area.

Publications projects require you to work closely with clients and world-renowned opinion leaders to produce publications that communicate key scientific and clinical data to a wide audience. This includes the development of abstracts and manuscripts, as well as posters and oral presentations for large international congresses, with the opportunity to provide on-site support at such events. In addition, you may have the chance to work on regulatory documents, lay summaries and policy-related publications. This role is for those looking to apply their scientific writing and creative skills to deliver high-impact publication projects to a wide range of clients.

Medical affairs projects provide the scientific bridge between clinical development and commercial functions in pharmaceutical and device companies. Most activities have a strong patient and/or healthcare professional focus, and act to educate and inform clinical decision making and patient care, or to gather insights that inform a product’s clinical development. You will work closely with our clients to present the ‘science behind the product’ through a wide range of projects including medical education events, advisory boards and medical information materials. You will collaborate with and support expert advisors and event speakers, and the requirement for on-site support at certain events provides opportunities for international travel. You will develop a complementary set of strong scientific, creative and writing skills, as well as the opportunity to become extremely knowledgeable about the therapy areas in which you work. The ability to creatively present scientific information is central to this role.

Market Access – Analyst

Within the healthcare sector, the market access process is essential to ensuring that novel pharmaceuticals and medical devices are reimbursed and rapidly made available to patients who need them. Our Market Access team supports a wide range of clients in producing materials to demonstrate both the clinical and economic value of some of the newest, most innovative technologies in development. Our work is multidisciplinary, often beginning with evidence generation in the form of literature reviews, advisory boards with clinicians and payers, or economic modelling, to inform the development of global materials that present an evidence-based account of the product’s value in a compelling and accessible manner. As a result, our work has a direct impact on patient access to medicines worldwide. A role in the Market Access team suits those who are passionate about patient access to healthcare, are fast-learners and have a strategic, problem solving mindset. Exceptional writing skills are also essential, especially the ability to summarize complex data in a clear and creative way with an excellent attention to detail.

Evidence Development – Analyst

The work of our Evidence Development team encompasses literature reviews and synthesis projects as well as real-world evidence projects.

Literature reviews and synthesis projects involve the identification of clinical, economic and real-world evidence to support the value of a pharmaceutical product or medical device. Our work includes rigorous systematic literature reviews that can be used to inform meta-analyses and network meta-analyses, as well as more creative and pragmatic evidence reviews to inform clients’ strategic decisions with regard to clinical development or market access. You will gain a thorough understanding of how to conduct various kinds of evidence review from searching to interpretation of results, ensuring that the reviews conform to industry guidelines where applicable. You will also be involved in transforming the methods and results of the reviews into engaging reports and slide sets.

Real-world evidence projects include the design, execution and subsequent reporting of prospective, retrospective or cross-sectional real-world studies. We develop protocols and statistical analysis plans (in collaboration with our Statisticians, Epidemiologists, clients and external experts), acquire and analyze data, and communicate the methodologies and results in both written and oral formats.

A role in the Evidence Development team particularly suits those who are passionate about synthesizing and generating evidence, have excellent attention to detail and organizational skills, and a talent for communication.

Rare Diseases – Analyst

To date, over seven thousand rare diseases have been identified but only four hundred have an approved treatment; our specialised Rare Diseases team supports this sector in overcoming the unique challenges they face, such as an urgent need to bring treatments to patients, little clinical or health economic evidence and limited understanding of the condition across the clinical community and society as a whole. By joining this team, you will develop the appropriate skills and deliver projects that require a broad range of technical expertise and knowledge across all of our service offerings, including literature reviews, the development of global economic models and publications, and the organisation of medical education events. You will also have the opportunity to work on some of the most cutting-edge treatments, such as gene therapies, supporting patients in accessing potentially lifechanging treatments. This is an exciting time to join our growing Rare Diseases team and to apply your exceptional written and technical skills to the rare diseases field, leading to a measurable impact on access to novel, often life-extending, treatments for rare disease patients.

At CarGurus (NASDAQ: CARG), our mission is to give people the power to reach their destination. We started as a small team of developers determined to bring trust and transparency to car shopping. Since then, our history of innovation and go-to-market acceleration has driven industry-leading growth. In fact, we're the largest and fastest-growing automotive marketplace, and we've been profitable for over 15 years.

What we do
The market is evolving, and we are too, moving the entire automotive journey online and guiding our customers through every step. That includes everything from the sale of an old car to the financing, purchase, and delivery of a new one. Today, tens of millions of consumers visit CarGurus.com each month, and ~30,000 dealerships use our products. But they're not the only ones who love CarGurus—our employees do, too. We have a people-first culture that fosters kindness, collaboration, and innovation, and empowers our Gurus with tools to fuel their career growth. Disrupting a trillion-dollar industry requires fresh and diverse perspectives. Come join us for the ride!

Role overview

We are looking for a Senior Product Data Analyst to join our Special Projects team which tackles complex and unstructured projects that span across our numerous business verticals. You will frequently collaborate with various embedded product analytics teams to provide support and innovate for challenging builds and analyses.

Our Product Data Analytics org as a whole supports our Product and Engineering teams, providing the final word on all analytics for CarGurus' user and dealer experiences. We are looking for thoughtful, curious, internally driven candidates who can dive into complex data and draw novel, insightful conclusions.

What you'll tackle

Exploration: Using your SQL expertise, conduct exploratory empirical analyses that bridge disparate data sources (e.g. website usage, subscription records, inventory volumes, etc.) to quantify product performance, user behavior, and/or market trends. Doing so will require distilling unstructured ""big data"" into actionable insights. Creatively compress sweeping, high-level exploratory requests into specific calculations that address your stakeholders' underlying needs. Relentlessly dig into the data – consulting with other individuals and teams as you judge necessary – beyond the letter of the initial assignment, to hammer out any anomalies or self-direct your inquiry into other relevant issues. Be comfortable escalating and automating your analyses using R/Python scripting.
Experimentation: Be the authority on A/B experimentation, advising engineers and product managers on everything from the necessary data points to collect, required sample sizes, optimal metrics to examine, robustness of numerical findings, and the bottom-line success or failure of the tested changes. Provide technical guidance on and ideas for improving A/B testing-related tools, algorithms, and automated processes. Conduct self-directed research on the latest trends in A/B experimentation, and map out internal improvements based on your findings.
Advocacy: Advocate for specific, data-driven product innovations that help further high-level company strategy, primarily in partnership with the Product/Engineering teams. Participate in brainstorming and planning discussions across the organization to these ends. Avoid passivity in the face of flawed proposals; tactfully and persuasively push back against potential missteps.
Metrics: Craft the metrics that define business success, condensing abstract or loosely-defined concepts down to concrete calculations. Audit and improve existing metrics to better inform the business' needs.
Visualizations: Build intuitive dashboards and other visual monitoring tools to guide daily decision-making by senior stakeholders and the company at large. Experiment with new kinds of visualizations that you believe could be better utilized in the organization. Re-work underlying code to appropriately structure visualization inputs.
Communication: Communicate and present complex quantitative findings in easily digestible terms to company leadership, homing in on key takeaways. Concretely and informatively respond to any probing, on-the-spot follow-up questions from senior decision-makers.
Architecture: Conceive of new data assets and build automated transformations (via DBT, LookML, etc.) to bring them to fruition. Partner with Data Engineering teams to advance core data modeling/architecture (e.g. user clickstream logging), by optimizing, integrating, and distilling large raw datasets and metadata. Draw upon prior experience with expansive, unrefined datasets to fix modeling bottlenecks in quick, scalable, outside-of-the-box ways.

Who you are

Bachelors/Masters Degree with 4+ years (or PhD with 2+ years) of experience in an analytics or analytics-adjacent field, ideally involving complex data modeling, quantitative analysis, and applied statistics.
2+ years of experience communicating the results of analyses to leadership teams to influence strategy
Expert fluency in SQL. Strong background with either R or Python is highly desirable.
Second-nature understanding of core statistical concepts (regression, significance testing, omitted variable bias, independence/dependence, etc.)
Knack for creative data visualizations.
Willingness to step outside your role and independently come up with novel ideas for the business.
Willingness to challenge others' ideas and advocate for your own.
Excellent verbal and written communication skills. Very comfortable presenting high-impact and potentially sensitive findings to senior leadership.
Strong project planning skills, with experience building roadmaps, estimating required resources, and flagging inter-dependencies with other teams/projects.
Preferred tools/programs: Snowflake, Snowplow, DBT, Looker, Jira, Salesforce, Google/MS suite

We reward our Gurus' curiosity and passion with best-in-class benefits and compensation, including equity for all employees, both when they start and as they continue to grow with us.
