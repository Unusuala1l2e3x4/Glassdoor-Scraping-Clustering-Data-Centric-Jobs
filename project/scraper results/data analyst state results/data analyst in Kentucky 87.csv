","Louisville, KY",-1,3.9,"The In-Home Assessment Senior Program Performance Analyst assists in identifying risks in IHWA performance and explores strategic opportunities to improve performance. Candidates need to be able to perform quick analysis, work with supporting analytics teams to design operational reporting to identify performance gaps sooner and deliver performance summaries for leadership updates. This Senior position is critical to the program maximizing IHWA visits and delivering on Retail Bid goals.

Responsibilities

In-home Health and Well-being Assessment (IHWA) is a program within Humana’s Medicare Risk Adjustment under the Clinical, Quality, and Enterprise Solutions organization that delivers ~1M face to face member visits per year. We contract with 2 primary vendors to send clinicians to spend 45-60 minutes with the member to review their medications, document the member’s conditions, conduct screenings, educate the member and answer their questions, observe the member and their home environment, connect the member back to their PCP, and refer members to Humana Clinical resources to address unmanaged conditions or SDOH needs.

With continued clinician capacity constraints within the healthcare industry, the IHWA program is projected to miss on some goals in 2023. The team is currently building robust tools and datasets that is allowing us to push back on unrealistic vendor projections. The program has a lot of opportunity to build more leading indicator reporting for completions, improve performance projections, identify opportunities to increase IHWA visits, and improve bid goal setting.

The In-Home Assessment Senior Program Performance Analyst will be tasked with designing, drafting, and using reporting to identify gaps in performance, predict performance using leading indicators, create transparency to push back on vendor projections and confidence, and provide input to set annual bid goals with the vendors. Some key KPIs are IHWA visit volumes and completion rates at the program, vendor, & state levels. Major partners for collaboration on issues, opportunities, and solutions are IHWA Director, leaders, SMEs, Vendor Managers and Vendors, MRA Finance, Prospective Programs Analytics, and HTA Analytics.


The In-Home Assessment Senior Program Performance Analyst will need to be proficient in SQL and Excel to quickly analyze data and to design ongoing reporting in Power BI with support of Business Intelligence reporting teams. Experience with operational reporting is needed to identify leading indicators (scheduled visits, cancellation rates, clinician staffing, et al) to project performance ourselves and compare to vendor projections.

The In-Home Assessment Senior Program Performance Analyst will exercise some independent judgment and decision making on moderately complex issues and will work under minimal supervision, while delivering actionable transparency for Vendor Managers to push on vendors and helping to form accurate expectations for the markets and executive leadership.
