","Mountain View, CA",,3.6,"Position Summary

The Clinical Data Integration Analyst (the “IA”) is responsible for using data tools to perform the tasks of mapping, harmonizing, and ‘enhancing’ data from a customer source system, such as the EMR. The IA collaborates with the client's technical staff to determine the best and most practical way to meet the data requirements of products. The IA works with partners to transform data and populate a production environment with the required specifications (e.g. FHIR standard).

The IA will be involved during the deployment phase with the primary workstream of mapping healthcare EHR data to standard HL7 FHIR schemas. Once the customer is live, IAs may spend 10-20% of their time performing maintenance activities on all deployed customer mappings. Maintenance activities can include changing or updating mapping logic based on user feedback, data quality issues, or new product requirements. The analyst may also need to perform

technical tasks related to managing changes in our data stream that result from client EMR upgrades.

Role Responsibilities:

Performing actual mapping tasks using SQL-based configuration and hierarchical, layered transformation of source schema to meet target output schema specifications as defined by HL7 FHIR and product specifications.
Leveraging knowledge of common EHR schemas and datasets to determine the optimal mapping logic and design for long-term viability and maintenance.
Strategizing with client IT personnel on the most practical methods to meet the data requirements for a given data source.
Analyzing samples of actual client data to evaluate data quality and availability. Understanding and documenting the client-side EHR workflow and its implications on the data we map from.
Performing comprehensive data validation and troubleshooting data issues through problem-solving with internal and external stakeholders.
Clearly documenting all assumptions and important steps during the mapping process and tracking the progress towards completion of the spec.
Providing ongoing feedback to product and engineering teams on internal tool development.
Training and onboarding clients and partners on mapping activities and workflows.

Role Requirements:

Bachelor’s degree in Healthcare Information Management Systems, Health Informatics, Information Technology, or any other relevant field.
Clinical experience (e.g., a Nurse Informaticist) as a plus
2- 4 years of significant experience with a SQL based query language and a strong understanding of relational databases as well as ETL related activities.
2-4 years of significant experience working with common data transformation tasks and strong familiarity with a data pipeline and data transfer mechanisms, particularly healthcare-specific methods (e.g. HL7v2, FHIR, Dicom, ETL)
Significant depth/experience in one or more EMRs (e.g. Epic Clarity, Cerner, Meditech) and comfort with common healthcare ontologies (ICD-10, LOINC, SNOMED, etc.)
Experience in health IT, ideally working in an interoperability-related role at a health system, EMR or vendor.
