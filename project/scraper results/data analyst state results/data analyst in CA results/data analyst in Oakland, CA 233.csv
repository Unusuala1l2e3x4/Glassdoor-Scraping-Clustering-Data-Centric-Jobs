SELECTION PROCEDURES

Written Core Examination (Weight: 40%)

Candidates will be invited to participate in a written, multiple-choice examination, designed to measure their relative knowledge, skills and abilities in job-related areas. The “core” multiple-choice examination component may include but not be limited to:

Ability to evaluate/analyze information/data and to exercise good judgment relative to that evaluation or analysis
Knowledge of, and ability to apply, financial/fiscal principles (including the ability to use mathematical and statistical formulas)
Ability to use various computer software programs.

Supervisory Test Battery - (Weight: 60%)

Candidates who attain a minimum passing score on the written core examination component will be invited to participate in a computer-based examination designed to measure competencies in job-related areas which may include but not be limited to: Problem Solving; Leadership; Decision Making; Interpersonal skill; Human Resources Management; Team Building; Communication & Conflict Management. For more information about this Supervisory Test (and a suggested reading list) please visit:

http://www.sfdhr.org/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=11676

A passing score must be achieved on the Written Multiple-Choice Examination and the Supervisory Test Battery in order to continue in the selection process.

The above test components are considered standardized and, therefore, test questions and answers are not available for public inspection or review.

Candidates may receive two or more scores in association with the above selection components. One or more will correspond to the core component of the multiple-choice exam component (i.e., core examination and/or one or more specialty areas). Those candidates who participate in the Supervisory Test Battery, will attain an additional score.

Any scores attained on each of these components will be valid and 'banked' for three years, starting from the date of the examination. This means that, during this three-year time period, you will not be required to take any test components for which you have already attained a score. Your score on the Core Exam is not valid for any other classifications in the Admin Analyst Series. You cannot apply a score from the Core exam used for 1820, 1822, or 1823, as it is a different test.

The Supervisory Test Battery may be used for many other classes, therefore your test score may be applied to other classes if you choose to apply to future recruitments. If the selection process for the future announcement is held within one year of the date of this examination and it includes any of these components (i.e., core exam, specialty subtest(s) and/or supervisory test battery), your score(s) for the corresponding test component(s) will be automatically applied to that announcement. However, after one year, you have the option to either (a) apply your test score(s) to the other announcement or (b) re-take the test component(s). Re-testing is permitted no sooner than one year from the date of the examination and only in association with your eligibility for another announcement for which the test component (core, specialty subtest or supervisory test battery) is used. Please note that, should you re-test, your re-test score would become your official score since it is the most recent.

Qualified applicants must achieve a passing score in order to be ranked on the eligible list/score report. Successful applicants will be placed on the eligible list/score report, in rank order, according to their final score.

Note: A passing score on the Written Core Examination must be achieved in order to be placed/ranked on the Eligible List. Candidates will be placed on the eligible list in rank order according to their final score. The department may utilize additional selection procedures to make a final hiring decision. Candidate scores on this examination may also be applied to other announcements involving other job titles when directed by the Human Resources Director.


Note: Only those applicants meeting the Minimum Qualifications will be notified of the exact date, time, and place to report to the Written Core Exam.

Candidates MUST achieve a passing score on both components of the Selection processes above in order to move forward in the Selection process. Candidate scores will be used to determine the final score and rank on the eligible list/score report.

After application submission, candidates deemed qualified must complete all subsequent steps to advance in this selection process, which includes the following:

Minimum Qualification Supplemental Questionnaire (MQSQ)

Candidates will be required to complete a MQSQ as part of the employment application. This MQSQ is designed to obtain specific information regarding an applicant's experience in relation to the Minimum Qualifications (MQ) for this position. The MQSQ will be used to evaluate if the applicant possesses the required minimum qualifications.


Additional Information

However, an eligible list shall be made available for public inspection, upon request, once the eligible list is exhausted or expired and referrals resolved.
