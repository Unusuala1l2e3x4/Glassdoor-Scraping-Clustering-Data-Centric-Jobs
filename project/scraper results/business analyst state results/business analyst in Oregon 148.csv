Job Description:
WORKING AT THE OREGON DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY
At the Oregon Department of Energy, we're helping shape the state's energy future. Our team is dedicated to keeping Oregon on the leading edge of renewable energy and efficiency while supporting energy innovation, investment, equity, and resilience. From helping Oregonians save energy at home; to overseeing the state's interests in the world's largest environmental cleanup at the Hanford nuclear site in Washington, our work is challenging, rewarding, and diverse. We work with developers and communities on proposed energy facilities, with schools and manufacturers looking to save energy and money, and with other agencies and stakeholders on meeting the challenges of climate change. Oregon is one of the most energy-efficient states in the country, routinely landing near the top of annual national rankings. ODOE is committed to helping Oregon remain an energy leader, and that starts with hiring engaged team members ready to deliver for all Oregonians.
The Energy Development Services (EDS) Division administers grant programs to tribes, businesses, households, nonprofits, and the public sector to help Oregonians implement conservation, energy efficiency, resilience, and renewable energy projects. Current programs include the Solar + Storage Rebate Program, the Community Renewable Energy Grant Program, the Energy Efficient Wildfire Rebuilding Program, two heat pump programs, and a new federally funded Grid Resilience program. This Division is also responsible for overseeing the close-out of legacy incentive programs and related projects, including the Small-Scale Energy Loan Program.
We encourage people from all backgrounds to apply for our positions and hope you will join us on our path to diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Retirement

Oregon Public Employees’ Retirement System – Jackson County participates in the State of Oregon Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS). PERS has Tier One, Tier Two, and the Oregon Public Service Retirement Plan (OPSRP) pension programs, as well as the Individual Account Program (IAP). Tier One covers members hired before January 1, 1996; Tier Two covers members hired between January 1, 1996 and August 28, 2003; and OPSRP covers members hired on or after August 29, 2003.

IAP contains all member contributions (6% of covered salary, currently County-paid) made on or after January 1, 2004. The legislature created the IAP in 2003 to provide an individual account-based retirement benefit for new workers hired on or after August 29, 2003, and for Tier One/Tier Two members active on or after January 1, 2004. The IAP benefit is in addition to the member’s other retirement program benefit (i.e., Tier One, Tier Two, or OPSRP). Employees are automatically vested in their IAP account when their account is established.

IAP Redirect - Per Senate Bill 1049 (2019) contributions remain at the rate of 6% however, a portion of that 6% is redirected to the Employee Pension Stability Account (EPSA). 2.5% is redirected for the Tier 1 and Tier 2 members and 0.75% is redirected for OPSRP members. The rest of the county-paid contribution is directed to the employee’s IAP. Employee’s may choose to make voluntary contributions for the amount of the redirect through the Oregon PERS Online Member Services (OMS) at www.oregon.gov/PERS.

Salary Limit - Beginning January 1, 2020, SB 1049 changed the definition of “salary” for PERS purposes and created new limitations on annual and monthly “subject salaries.” Your salary is used to determined member Individual Account Program (IAP) contributions, employer contributions to fund the pension program, and the final average salary used in calculating retirement benefits under formula methods. The 2022 limit $210,582 per year. The limit is prorated when members work fewer than 12 months in a calendar year.

OPSRP is designed to provide approximately 45 percent of an employee’s final average salary at retirement (for a general service member with a 30-year career or a police and firefighter member with a 25-year career).

OPSRP General Service: Unless employees are in a police or firefighter position, they are considered a general service member. In addition to other retirement programs or any social security benefit, when employees retire, if vested, PERS will calculate monthly benefit using the following formula:

1.5 percent x years of retirement credit x final average salary. Normal retirement age for general service members is age 65, or age 58 with 30 years of retirement credit.

General Service Benefit Calculation Example (employees can estimate benefits using any number of years and any final average salary)

Final average salary: $45,000
Retirement credit: 30 years as an OPSRP member
30 (years) x 1.5 percent = 45 percent
45 percent x $3,750 (final average monthly salary) = $1,687.50
Single Life Option monthly benefit = $1,687.50 ($20,250 annual benefit)

OPSRP Police and Firefighter (P&F): To be classified as a P&F member at retirement, employees must have been employed continuously as a P&F member for at least five years immediately preceding their retirement. In addition to other retirement programs or any social security benefit, when employees retire, if vested, PERS will calculate monthly benefit using the following formula:

1.8 percent x years of retirement credit x final average salary. Normal retirement age for P&F members is age 60, or age 53 with 25 years of retirement credit.

P&F Benefit Calculation Example (employees can estimate their benefit using any number of years and any final average salary)

Final average salary: $45,000
Retirement credit: 25 years as an OPSRP member
25 (years) x 1.8 percent = 45 percent
45 percent of $3,750 (final average monthly salary) = $1,687.50
Single Life Option monthly benefit = $1,687.50 ($20,250 annual benefit)

Voluntary Deferred Compensation Program – Jackson County offers regular employees the option to enroll in IRS Section 457 Deferred Compensation Retirement Plans. The employee defers compensation through voluntary payroll deductions into this supplemental retirement plan. The 457 plan is a separate retirement plan from PERS.

Other Benefits

Voluntary Direct Deposit – An employee may choose to have their payroll check automatically deposited into their bank account. Employees can choose up to four accounts to receive direct deposit funds. Most banks allow participation of this program.

Voluntary Flexible Spending Account (FSA), Section 125 Plan – The FSA is a tax-free regular employee-funded account. Regular employees may choose to participate in pre-tax health insurance premiums, out-of-pocket unreimbursed eligible health care expenses, dependent care expenses, and qualified transportation expenses, in order to have “before-tax” dollars deducted from their paychecks.

Employee Assistance Program (EAP) – The County has a fully-funded Employee Assistance Program (EAP) to offer. The EAP is a FREE and CONFIDENTIAL benefit that can assist you and your eligible family members with personal problems, large or small. The EAP provides confidential services to help people privately resolve problems that may interfere with work, family, and life. The EAP is offered to regular employees, their dependents, and any household members. Services include up to four face-to-face counseling sessions per year, 24/7/365 access to crisis counselors, and convenient access to on-line consultations with licensed counselors.",-1,State & Regional Agencies,$100 to $500 million (USD),Government & Public Administration,1001 to 5000 Employees,Government,False
