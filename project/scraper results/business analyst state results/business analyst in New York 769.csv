Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all New Yorkers, in service of a vision of a city in which all New Yorkers can realize their full health potential, regardless of who they are, how old they are, where they are from, or where they live.

As a world-renowned public health agency with a history of building transformative public health programming and infrastructure, innovating in science and scholarship to advance public health knowledge, and responding to urgent public health crises from New York City’s yellow fever outbreak in 1822, to the COVID-19 pandemic we are a hub for public health innovation, expertise, and programs, and services. We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.

Our Agency’s five strategic priorities, building off a recently-completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are:
1) To re-envision how the Health Department prepares for and responds to health emergencies, with a focus on building a “response-ready” organization, with faster decision-making, transparent public communications, and stronger surveillance and bridges to healthcare systems 2) Address and prevent chronic and diet-related disease, including addressing rising rates of childhood obesity and the impact of diabetes, and transforming our food systems to improve nutrition and enhance access to healthy foods

True to our value of equity as a foundational element of all of our work, and a critical foundation to achieving population health impact in New York City, the NYC Health Department has been a leader in recognizing and dismantling racism’s impacts on the health of New Yorkers and beyond. In 2021, the NYC Board of Health declared racism as a public health crisis. With commitment to advance anti-racist public health practices that dismantle systems that perpetuate inequitable power, opportunity and access, the NYC Health Department continues to work in and with communities and community organizations to increase their access to health services and decrease avoidable health outcomes.

Kanter Auto is seeking an entrepreneurial and data-driven Operations Analyst to join our team.

You'll work closely with him to implement new systems, simplify processes, eliminate waste, and build a strong foundation of operational data. You will be given the opportunity to identify and launch projects independently and will have a major impact on our company's performance.

If you want to learn about all the operational aspects of running and growing a high-performance eCommerce business, this is the opportunity for you.

About Kanter Auto

Welcome to our company – an iconic name in the vintage automotive parts and accessories industry for the past sixty years. As of June 2023, we are proud to announce that we are under new ownership, embarking on an exciting new chapter of growth and innovation.

Our legacy as a retailer has been built on providing high-quality parts and unmatched expertise in the classic car market. If you are passionate about operational excellence and want to be part of a company that is dedicated to serving the vintage parts market with renewed energy and vision, come join us on this exciting journey of transformation and advancement. Together, we can shape the future of the aftermarket parts industry.

Who we're looking for:

To be a great fit for this job, you must have:

Previous experience establishing new processes and systems. Previous consulting experience strongly preferred, but not required. (Our new CEO is a previous Accenture consultant and the owner of another successful ecommerce company.)
A data-driven mindset and very strong familiarity with Excel (VLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH). You know how to structure datasets in order to derive insights and solve business problems.
The ability to dive in, analyze the current process, and quickly develop an understanding of how to improve things. You are a very fast learner.
Very strong general familiarity with technology. You do not need to be an expert in warehouse and operational systems, but you need to be very comfortable with learning new systems and doing some configuration yourself. You know what an API is. Netsuite or other ERP knowledge is a plus.
Excellent analytical and process skills. For example, you can set up a lightweight, efficient system to capture weights and dimensions, barcode, and take eCommerce photos for thousands of products that will run well without your constant involvement.

Had you been with us last month, you would have…

Built an Excel model for forecasting inventory purchasing based on data from an old ERP that requires significant analysis to correct the data.
Reviewed our vendors by category and identified critical sourcing projects that must be started.
Assessed our site technology needs (workstations, networking, security) and managed the project from quote through implementation.
Assisted with our Netsuite ERP implementation by gathering data, analyzing current processes to determine requirements, and learning the system.
Received the instruction “we need to barcode our products” and figured out a plan how to make that happen, from beginning to end, for tens of thousands of items.

If you work with us, within the next two years it's likely that you'll:

Lead an assessment project to plan a move to a more modern warehouse facility.
Develop a process to systematically review and process more than 100,000 square feet of vintage auto parts, working with partners in eCommerce and wholesale sales to make them available for sale.
Implement strict inventory control procedures by improving receiving, shipping, and implementing periodic inventory counts.
Set up a large-scale process for capturing product weights, dimensions, and product photography for tens of thousands of products.
Visit other companies to learn about best practices that can be implemented in our facility

Qualities that will make you a good fit for Kanter Auto:

Technology Fluency. You can learn a new application faster than almost anyone around you.
Independence and Efficiency. You get things done faster than your peers and are always improving your execution. You have the right information at your fingertips because you planned in advance. You can independently manage a huge backlog by identifying actions from high-level objectives and prioritizing intelligently. You follow through on all your commitments, on time.

We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.

Our Agency’s five strategic priorities, building off a recently-completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are:

KKR sponsors investment funds that invest in private equity, credit and real assets and has strategic partners that manage hedge funds. KKR’s insurance subsidiaries offer retirement, life and reinsurance products under the management of The Global Atlantic Financial Group.




TEAM OVERVIEW

KKR Capstone is KKR’s operations group and a unique “CEO University” for executives. KKR Capstone’s mission is to deliver exceptional returns on KKR’s investments by partnering with management teams to drive value in KKR portfolio companies, as well as integrating within deal teams to select the right assets. At portfolio companies, KKR Capstone drives the most important operational issues on the CEO and Board of Directors’ agendas, including top-line growth, cost optimization, organizational structure and capability, capital investment, and strategic M&A initiatives. During due diligence, KKR Capstone joins deal teams in evaluating potential acquisitions, including weighing in on crucial operational issues and value creation levers, assessing the target company’s market, and understanding the strength of the company’s position in the industry.

On a day-to-day basis, KKR Capstone executives interact with a broad range of company personnel including the Board, C-suite and line-level operators. The majority of KKR Capstone team members have previous experience in management consulting. While our executives heavily leverage the skills and experience gained in consulting, they spend the bulk of their time identifying, rapidly prototyping, and implementing operational improvement initiatives (i.e. less time doing PowerPoint, more time dealing with real general management challenges and executing real initiatives).

KKR Capstone provides a unique opportunity for high-performing candidates to drive real operating change and value creation in a private equity environment, gaining valuable experience as general managers. KKR Capstone executives are expected to take ownership of key priorities and initiatives at the portfolio company, are held accountable for individual results, and are typically the primary agents of change within the organization. Over time, team members can rise within KKR Capstone, transition into opportunities within the broader KKR firm, or take senior operating roles inside or outside the KKR portfolio. Due to the unique hands-on operating experience that KKR Capstone executives gain, ~70% of alums who have left the team in the past decade are now C-suite execs, and more than 1/3 are CEOs.

We believe that only true collaboration leads to innovation by converging at the intersection of our knowledge and our customers’ ambition and linking expertise with technology and problems with solutions.We’re a community, a movement that’s built at this intersection, which we call “the Cutting X”: it’s where supply chains evolve, and value chains are forged.

Our desire to work closely with them is also reflected in our global presence, with offices both in Europe and the US.

You will be part of a project team that is a mix of internal colleagues, supply chain planners, and managers from the client side, and you'll be doing stuff like this:
You support client workshops to gather requirements and understand the challenges tied to their planning and broader supply chain.

Job Description
Established in 1805, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (the NYC Health Department) is the oldest and largest health department in the country. Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all New Yorkers, in service of a vision of a city in which all New Yorkers can realize their full health potential, regardless of who they are, how old they are, where they are from, or where they live.

As a world-renowned public health agency with a history of building transformative public health programming and infrastructure, innovating in science and scholarship to advance public health knowledge, and responding to urgent public health crises from New York City’s yellow fever outbreak in 1822, to the COVID-19 pandemic we are a hub for public health innovation, expertise, and programs, and services. We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.

Our Agency’s five strategic priorities, building off a recently-completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are:
1) To re-envision how the Health Department prepares for and responds to health emergencies, with a focus on building a “response-ready” organization, with faster decision-making, transparent public communications, and stronger surveillance and bridges to healthcare systems 2) Address and prevent chronic and diet-related disease, including addressing rising rates of childhood obesity and the impact of diabetes, and transforming our food systems to improve nutrition and enhance access to healthy foods
3) Address the second pandemic of mental illness including: reducing overdose deaths, strengthening our youth mental health systems, and supporting people with serious mental illness
4) Reduce black maternal mortality and make New York a model city for women’s health
5) Mobilize against and combat the health impacts of climate change

Our 7,000-plus team members bring extraordinary diversity to the work of public health. True to our value of equity as a foundational element of all of our work, and a critical foundation to achieving population health impact in New York City, the NYC Health Department has been a leader in recognizing and dismantling racism’s impacts on the health of New Yorkers and beyond. In 2021, the NYC Board of Health declared racism as a public health crisis. With commitment to advance anti-racist public health practices that dismantle systems that perpetuate inequitable power, opportunity and access, the NYC Health Department continues to work in and with communities and community organizations to increase their access to health services and decrease avoidable health outcomes.
