You love connecting the dots and can never stop digging. You see a system, technology, widget, doodad, or contraption and you must know everything about it. You must know how it works, how effective it is, how it interacts with other gizmos. Heck, if it is good enough, you want to know how many you can buy. You want to know how it is used and how it can ever be used. This thing may not even exist yet and you want to fully understand it in every possible future.




And you know how to apply your knowledge of numbers to analytical challenges and come up with answers that make sense. You are also patient enough to explain to non-technical people what your numbers mean; this requires charts and graphs and other well thought out graphics that help make sense of your algorithms and equations. Your analysis will matter, and you will need to communicate it to your peers, customers, and history itself.

Simply put, you will break down problems into their various parts and analyze the effect that different changes and circumstances would have on each of the parts.

HOW WE LIVE OUR VALUES TO OUR TEAMMATES:

We're seeking those with passion for healthcare and relentless devotion to our goal. We need team members that embody our following core values:

1) We are human, first
Our humanity binds us together. We bring the same empathetic approach to every individual we engage with, whether it be our members, our clients, or each other. We are all worthy of respect and understanding and we engage in our interactions with care and intention. We honor our stories. We listen to—and hear—each other, we celebrate our differences and similarities, we are present for each other, and we strive for mutual understanding.

2) We redefine what is possible
We always look beyond the obstacles in front of us to imagine new solutions. We approach our work with inspiration from other industries, other leaders, and other challenges. We use ingenuity and resourcefulness when faced with tough problems.

3) We debate then commit
We believe that a spirit of open discourse is part of a healthy culture. We understand and appreciate different perspectives and we challenge our assumptions. When working toward a decision or a new solution, we actively listen to one another, approach it with a ""yes, and"" mentality, and assume positive intent. Once a decision is made, we align and champion it as one team.

4) We cultivate grit
Changing healthcare doesn't happen overnight. We reflect and learn from challenges and approach the future with a determination to strive for better. In the face of daunting situations, we value persistence. We embrace failure as a stepping stone to future success. On this journey, we seek to act with guts, resilience, initiative, and tenacity.

5) We seek to delight
Healthcare is complicated and personal. We work tirelessly to meet the goals of our clients while also delivering the best experience to our members. We recognize that no matter the role or team, we each play a crucial part in our members' care and take that responsibility seriously. When faced with an obstacle, we are kind, respectful, and solution-oriented in our approach. We hold ourselves accountable to our clients and our members' success.
