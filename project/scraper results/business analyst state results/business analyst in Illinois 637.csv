Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tom Welke. I am Partner & Vp at RSM Solutions Inc and I have been recruiting technical talent for over 20 years (it was 20 in January) and been in the tech sector since the 1990s. Due to this, I am going to be far more focused on 'fit' than anything else...a fit for you and a fit for the client. I also like to add some humor to job descriptions as well (life is too short not to have some humor), so if you see something that makes you chuckle, that was the intent.

This role is for one of my best friends. Sometimes, when you work on a role, it takes another turn...where you want to not only do your best, but you want to exceed your own expectations...this is such a role. So, as you can imagine, I know the hiring manager for this role very very well. Here are some things that creates a good social fit:

This is a role where we need someone that doesn't need to be micro managed. The hiring manager for this role really enjoys working with people that think through their actions. If you are the kind of person that doesn't like to be micro-managed but can put their big boy pants or big girl pants on and gets their work done, this role will be GREAT for you.
No ego. Let me explain. If you think you are God's gift to IT and believe that the world revolves around you, then you should probably run for Congress (I hear they are hiring)...because you wont be a fit here.

However, we are seeking someone within driving distance to Itasca, Illinois or Hanover Park, Illinois.

Here is what we are seeking: We are seeking a JDE E1 BA that specializes in that wonderful and ever-exciting world of manufacturing. You will do all those key things that 'classic"" BA's are involved it...that being requirements gathering, documentation, process flow diagramming (I bet you are getting excited with every word), QA and deployment. If - oh joy of joys - you have combined some of those nifty PM and BA skills together, oh man that would be great. You will assist with trainingand technical support to system end-users as well. As you might have guessed, you will develop test plans and integrate technology into other business operations. Think of this role as a techno functional lead role responsible for providing input and assisting in the development and implementation of business initiatives to support company operations and business decision-making.

Here are some of the key things we are looking for (I am not going to tell you about an exhaustive list of a zillion things, half of which don't exist...so, I will slim this down to the real 'meat':

Real live, and in-depth JDE E1 experience in those nifty manufacturing modules.
Lead the IT Labware support & implementation process.
Experience with all those things that BA's know very very well...requirements gathering, documentation, process flow diagramming, QA and project deployments...with specific focus on JDE E1. that JDE experience is an absolute must have.
Experience writing SQL queries, data extracts, and V-Lookups.
Experience preparing test data to assist technical analyst to debug and troubleshoot issues
Experience analyzing, designing, and writing functional specifications based on business requirements (with focus on ERP).
Experience designing the following: Menus, UXone UDO – (like Watchlist, E1 Pages, Orchestrator solutions, Advanced queries), BIP Output, E1 Batch application, E1 Interactive Applications.
Experience performing unit and integration testing.
Experience working with Upgrade, Migration, Integration projects as required.
Experience with AS IS Analysis, Mapping of JDE within existing systems, creating setups, User Training, Testing (unit and Integration), giving solutions to the client issues, data loading, Creating Menus Versions, Defining setups, Integration with other modules, preparation, and finalization of specs for report, documentation of the Business Processes, Setups, and User Manuals.

JD Edwards Business Analyst,"RSM Solutions Inc
","Itasca, IL",$70K - $95K (Employer est.),5.0,"Thank you for taking time to stop by and take a look at the BA role I have posted on Indeed. If you have read my job descriptions before, welcome back. If you are new to my job descriptions, welcome to the party.

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tom Welke. I am Partner & Vp at RSM Solutions Inc and I have been recruiting technical talent for over 20 years (it was 20 in January) and been in the tech sector since the 1990s. Due to this, I am going to be far more focused on 'fit' than anything else...a fit for you and a fit for the client. I also like to add some humor to job descriptions as well (life is too short not to have some humor), so if you see something that makes you chuckle, that was the intent.

This role is for one of my best friends. Sometimes, when you work on a role, it takes another turn...where you want to not only do your best, but you want to exceed your own expectations...this is such a role. So, as you can imagine, I know the hiring manager for this role very very well. Here are some things that creates a good social fit:

This is a role where we need someone that doesn't need to be micro managed. The hiring manager for this role really enjoys working with people that think through their actions. If you are the kind of person that doesn't like to be micro-managed but can put their big boy pants or big girl pants on and gets their work done, this role will be GREAT for you.
No ego. Let me explain. If you think you are God's gift to IT and believe that the world revolves around you, then you should probably run for Congress (I hear they are hiring)...because you wont be a fit here.

However, we are seeking someone within driving distance to Itasca, Illinois or Hanover Park, Illinois.

Here is what we are seeking: We are seeking a JDE E1 BA that specializes in that wonderful and ever-exciting world of manufacturing. You will do all those key things that 'classic"" BA's are involved it...that being requirements gathering, documentation, process flow diagramming (I bet you are getting excited with every word), QA and deployment. If - oh joy of joys - you have combined some of those nifty PM and BA skills together, oh man that would be great. You will assist with trainingand technical support to system end-users as well. As you might have guessed, you will develop test plans and integrate technology into other business operations. Think of this role as a techno functional lead role responsible for providing input and assisting in the development and implementation of business initiatives to support company operations and business decision-making.

Here are some of the key things we are looking for (I am not going to tell you about an exhaustive list of a zillion things, half of which don't exist...so, I will slim this down to the real 'meat':

Real live, and in-depth JDE E1 experience in those nifty manufacturing modules.
Lead the IT Labware support & implementation process.
Experience with all those things that BA's know very very well...requirements gathering, documentation, process flow diagramming, QA and project deployments...with specific focus on JDE E1. that JDE experience is an absolute must have.
Experience writing SQL queries, data extracts, and V-Lookups.

As for travel, we do that when we are in front of our clients leading them through BTS experiences and workshops we’ve created. And as we continue getting back to “normal,” you can expect that you’ll travel around 25-30% of the time, going to different cities to facilitate the incredible experiences you’ve designed.

What We’re Looking For

Curiosity. Resourcefulness. A humble and inclusive spirit. These are core attributes of BTS all-stars.

Strong business and financial acumen and a love for problem solving with a structured approach to scoping solutions to those problems. Advanced Excel skills (INDEX/MATCH, Lookups, IF statements) are a must. Modeling skills, as well as experience with programming languages, especially VBA, are big pluses. Backgrounds in engineering, finance, science, math, or economics are well-suited. We have team members from all kinds of backgrounds, work experience, and education. We love diversity and variety.

We do have a few requirements. Bachelor’s degree or equivalent experience is needed, as are strong written and verbal communication skills. Willingness to travel as indicated above.

Lastly, we require eligibility to work in the US permanently without sponsorship.

JD Edwards Business Analyst,"RSM Solutions Inc
","Itasca, IL",$70K - $95K (Employer est.),5.0,"Thank you for taking time to stop by and take a look at the BA role I have posted on Indeed. If you have read my job descriptions before, welcome back. If you are new to my job descriptions, welcome to the party.

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tom Welke. I am Partner & Vp at RSM Solutions Inc and I have been recruiting technical talent for over 20 years (it was 20 in January) and been in the tech sector since the 1990s. Due to this, I am going to be far more focused on 'fit' than anything else...a fit for you and a fit for the client. I also like to add some humor to job descriptions as well (life is too short not to have some humor), so if you see something that makes you chuckle, that was the intent.

This role is for one of my best friends. Sometimes, when you work on a role, it takes another turn...where you want to not only do your best, but you want to exceed your own expectations...this is such a role. So, as you can imagine, I know the hiring manager for this role very very well. Here are some things that creates a good social fit:

This is a role where we need someone that doesn't need to be micro managed. The hiring manager for this role really enjoys working with people that think through their actions. If you are the kind of person that doesn't like to be micro-managed but can put their big boy pants or big girl pants on and gets their work done, this role will be GREAT for you.
No ego. Let me explain. If you think you are God's gift to IT and believe that the world revolves around you, then you should probably run for Congress (I hear they are hiring)...because you wont be a fit here.

However, we are seeking someone within driving distance to Itasca, Illinois or Hanover Park, Illinois.

Here is what we are seeking: We are seeking a JDE E1 BA that specializes in that wonderful and ever-exciting world of manufacturing. You will do all those key things that 'classic"" BA's are involved it...that being requirements gathering, documentation, process flow diagramming (I bet you are getting excited with every word), QA and deployment. If - oh joy of joys - you have combined some of those nifty PM and BA skills together, oh man that would be great. You will assist with trainingand technical support to system end-users as well. As you might have guessed, you will develop test plans and integrate technology into other business operations. Think of this role as a techno functional lead role responsible for providing input and assisting in the development and implementation of business initiatives to support company operations and business decision-making.

Here are some of the key things we are looking for (I am not going to tell you about an exhaustive list of a zillion things, half of which don't exist...so, I will slim this down to the real 'meat':

Real live, and in-depth JDE E1 experience in those nifty manufacturing modules.
Lead the IT Labware support & implementation process.
Experience with all those things that BA's know very very well...requirements gathering, documentation, process flow diagramming, QA and project deployments...with specific focus on JDE E1. that JDE experience is an absolute must have.
Experience writing SQL queries, data extracts, and V-Lookups.
Experience preparing test data to assist technical analyst to debug and troubleshoot issues
Experience analyzing, designing, and writing functional specifications based on business requirements (with focus on ERP).
Experience designing the following: Menus, UXone UDO – (like Watchlist, E1 Pages, Orchestrator solutions, Advanced queries), BIP Output, E1 Batch application, E1 Interactive Applications.
Experience performing unit and integration testing.
Experience working with Upgrade, Migration, Integration projects as required.

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tom Welke. I am Partner & Vp at RSM Solutions Inc and I have been recruiting technical talent for over 20 years (it was 20 in January) and been in the tech sector since the 1990s. Due to this, I am going to be far more focused on 'fit' than anything else...a fit for you and a fit for the client. I also like to add some humor to job descriptions as well (life is too short not to have some humor), so if you see something that makes you chuckle, that was the intent.

This role is for one of my best friends. Sometimes, when you work on a role, it takes another turn...where you want to not only do your best, but you want to exceed your own expectations...this is such a role. So, as you can imagine, I know the hiring manager for this role very very well. Here are some things that creates a good social fit:

This is a role where we need someone that doesn't need to be micro managed. The hiring manager for this role really enjoys working with people that think through their actions. If you are the kind of person that doesn't like to be micro-managed but can put their big boy pants or big girl pants on and gets their work done, this role will be GREAT for you.
No ego. Let me explain. If you think you are God's gift to IT and believe that the world revolves around you, then you should probably run for Congress (I hear they are hiring)...because you wont be a fit here.

However, we are seeking someone within driving distance to Itasca, Illinois or Hanover Park, Illinois.

Here is what we are seeking: We are seeking a JDE E1 BA that specializes in that wonderful and ever-exciting world of manufacturing. You will do all those key things that 'classic"" BA's are involved it...that being requirements gathering, documentation, process flow diagramming (I bet you are getting excited with every word), QA and deployment. If - oh joy of joys - you have combined some of those nifty PM and BA skills together, oh man that would be great. You will assist with trainingand technical support to system end-users as well. As you might have guessed, you will develop test plans and integrate technology into other business operations. Think of this role as a techno functional lead role responsible for providing input and assisting in the development and implementation of business initiatives to support company operations and business decision-making.

Here are some of the key things we are looking for (I am not going to tell you about an exhaustive list of a zillion things, half of which don't exist...so, I will slim this down to the real 'meat':

Real live, and in-depth JDE E1 experience in those nifty manufacturing modules.
Lead the IT Labware support & implementation process.
Experience with all those things that BA's know very very well...requirements gathering, documentation, process flow diagramming, QA and project deployments...with specific focus on JDE E1. that JDE experience is an absolute must have.
Experience writing SQL queries, data extracts, and V-Lookups.
Experience preparing test data to assist technical analyst to debug and troubleshoot issues
Experience analyzing, designing, and writing functional specifications based on business requirements (with focus on ERP).
Experience designing the following: Menus, UXone UDO – (like Watchlist, E1 Pages, Orchestrator solutions, Advanced queries), BIP Output, E1 Batch application, E1 Interactive Applications.
Experience performing unit and integration testing.
Experience working with Upgrade, Migration, Integration projects as required.

CTI’S CULTURAL AND CORE VALUES

Always keep our Focus on the customer. We understand that each customer is a potential salesperson or critic of our business. As such, we want to turn that potential to our benefit by striving to do more than simply satisfy our customers. We want to delight our customers through each of their interactions with our company—from sales, service, and support to system reliability, content, and performance.




Maintain our Integrity. Ours is a company built on a foundation of honesty and solid ethics. We do what we say we are going to do and we do the right thing, not just the most profitable thing. Put Families First. The challenges and rewards of working at Joink/CTI are important to all but never at the expense of our families. We always strive to maintain a healthy balance between our lives at work and at home.




Work Hard, Play Hard, and Stay Positive. At Joink/CTI, our glass is always half full. We see challenges as opportunities, never as problems or downsides. We support each other and strive to do everything with gusto. We all work hard to make Joink/CTI a successful business and we remember to have fun along the way.




Communicate. We strive to keep talking and seeking input from the people around us. No one has all of the answers and success requires us to err on the side of overcommunication. No one has ever failed to do their job successfully due to an abundance of communication.




Check your Ego at the Door. We operate on strong teams built on personal relationships and genuine caring for others and their success. As such, we win or lose through our combined effort, not through the effort of any single contributor. That understanding makes ours an organization that champions the entrepreneurial spirit and deemphasizes hierarchy and titles.




Give Back to Others. “Of those to whom much is given, much is expected.” We recognize that our success comes from our customers and from the communities where we live and work. We actively seek opportunities to make a positive impact on those communities and the needs of the people within them.




Remember that Local is Key. The foundation of Joink/CTI’s success is rooted in the small Midwest towns and communities where our company saw its genesis. We must never lose sight of the fact that our success comes from providing the benefits of large company infrastructure to employees and customers who live and work locally

JOB DESCRIPTION -


Chicago Public Schools (CPS) is one of the largest school districts in the United States, serving over 320,000 students in 600+ schools and employing approximately 40,000 people, most of them teachers. CPS has set ambitious goals to ensure that every student, in every school and every neighborhood, has access to a world-class learning experience that prepares each for success in college, career, and civic life. In order to fulfill this mission, we make three commitments to our students, their families, and all Chicagoans: academic progress, financial stability, and integrity. Six core values are embedded within these commitments – student-centered, whole child, equity, academic excellence, community partnership, and continuous learning.

The Office of Information and Technology Services (ITS) works to build the capacity of schools to use information and technology, maintain network infrastructure, security standards, and support other departments to meet district goals. ITS provides innovative technology solutions that improve the quality of education for students, reduce the administrative burden on educators, facilitate parent interaction, increase community engagement, and support CPS’ mission of transparency by focusing on the ease and equity of access to information.

Ensure applications perform at a level commensurate with teacher data entry and reporting needs, especially during peak grade entry windows.
Maintain the integrity of application configurations including teacher gradebook setup, school grading scales, and grading calculations (e.g. final grades GPAs, summer school eligibility, etc.).
Collaborate with the Enterprise Training and Support team, departmental teams, and project teams to develop training plans and materials (guides, videos, announcements, communications, webinars, etc.) in response to changes to business rules, configuration of the application suite, and deployments of application enhancements. Training delivery will also be required, with the end goal of transitioning training tasks and knowledge to departmental and ITS supporting groups.
Maintain and enhance data integration interfaces including Google classroom, Skyline, Service Now, Parent and Student Portals, and other third-party tools as approved by ITS.
