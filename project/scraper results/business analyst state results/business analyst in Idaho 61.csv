Workforce Solutions Portfolio Senior Business Analyst,"HP
","Boise, ID",$88K - $126K (Glassdoor est.),4.1,"Workforce Solutions (WS) is a new global business unit that brings together all commercial services teams across HP under one leader with a goal of providing a comprehensive portfolio of compelling services and solutions to our enterprise, mid-market, and even – in partnership with our strategic channel partners – to the SMB segment. Our goal is to enable CIOs to optimize the IT experience of their workforce while balancing other business pressures of affordability and risk. HP’s core strengths in personal systems and computing, printing and document workflows, and advanced collaboration solutions provide the foundation from which we will expand our services portfolio. Our passion for our customer and our employees will be our differentiation.

Fundamentally, you will assess the performance of future & existing offerings within the Workforce Solutions portfolio. This assessment will facilitate executive decision-making on resource allocation and prioritization – to maximize the return on investment and overall portfolio value.

In order to do this, you will perform deep analysis on the data. The data we have is vast – spanning multiple metric types, sources, and categories. Your job will be to dissect this data to find the nuggets of insight that help us optimize the portfolio offering and drive substantial growth for the business. You will need to have insatiable curiosity, and the drive to pose and test many different hypotheses against the data available.

You will use the insights you capture to make thoughtful and well-structured strategic recommendations to the senior leadership team within Workforce Solutions. Those recommendations will include refinements to optimize existing offerings, opportunities for growth that warrant investment, and areas to de-invest based on business performance. You will provide thought leadership to the senior leaders.

But recommendations without action do nothing. So you will also champion the changes needed within the service lines of the portfolio based on those recommendations. You will partner with the service line leads on synthesis of the insights, and answer questions needed in the execution of process improvements to existing products and service offerings. Similarly, you will also drive performance-centric improvements into the New Service Introduction (NSI) process used to launch products and services by closely partnering with the NSI team.

Driving our portfolio to be best-in-class will also require understanding of the industry. To that end, you will need to coordinate occasional external research to understand the performance attributes and characteristics of other key players in the technology services industry. This research will inform the recommendations you make to the Workforce Solutions leadership.

Finally, you will continually evolve the analysis process itself to be more automated over time. This automation will likely include (but not be limited to) heavier reliance on artificial intelligence. So, understanding the trends in this space and partnering with other groups within HP on the implementation of AI and other tools will be part of this role.

Responsibilities
Develops insights from complex data and business analyses across the business portfolio and formulates them into business improvement and investment recommendations.
Identifies and champions the need for new and highly innovative statistical and financial models to analyze new aspects of business performance.
Develops comprehensive business plan recommendations, based on analysis, emerging trends, experience, and partnership with service line leads.
Provides subject matter expertise regarding the optimal business metrics to use for assessing and driving the highest return on investment for the business as a whole
Champions and partners to implement actions within the businesses to improve performance (based on the analysis insights and recommendations generated)
Provides coaching and expertise to other analysts who are assessing business performance for their specific service lines within the portfolio
Identifies and coordinates the inclusion of performance-specific improvements and enhancements (gates, deliverables, etc.) to the New Service Introduction process – to proactively enable optimal business performance for new services and products that are released
Coordinates and conducts external research into performance metrics and results within the technology services industry – to compare against (and evolve toward) best-in-class
Partners with Data Science teams to evolve the automation of analysis using AI and other cutting- edge analytical tools, models, and methods for making key business decisions.

Education & Experience Required
Typically 10+ years total experience in strategy, planning, operations, finance, or related functional area.
Advanced university degree required (e.g., MBA) or demonstrable equivalent experience.
Extensive business analysis experience in the technology services industry strongly desired.

Knowledge & Skills
Extensive technical experience diving deep into vast and sometimes disparate datasets to glean insights and make improvement recommendations
Excellent analytical thinking, technical analysis, and data manipulation skills.
Superior business acumen and technical knowledge within area of responsibility.
Ability to leverage new analytical techniques to develop creative approaches and insights.
Extensive knowledge of how to analyze business problems using Excel, Power BI, statistical analysis, and financial modeling. Experience working in R and Python desired.
Insatiable curiosity and the drive to seek out new and novel insights through hypothesis creation and testing
Extensive experience working cross-functionally and influencing business decisions, with strong partnership and collaboration skills
Excellent verbal and written communication skills, including negotiation and influence skills.
Excellent project management skills, including leading large, cross-functional initiatives that impact the organization.
Strong leadership skills, including team-building, conflict resolution, and management.
Ability to identify emerging trends from market and industry data, and make clear and compelling business planning recommendations.
