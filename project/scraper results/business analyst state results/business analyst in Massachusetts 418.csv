Having contact center experience and background is critical. Contact center is a very unique beast compared to regular projects. So having that knowledge is critical. The core technology (Genesy, Avaya, RingCentral) etc. is not relevant. RingCentral and Pete's team have the technical infrastructure piece covered. Ultimately all these platforms are very similar.
