Operations Analyst,Kanter Auto,"Boonton, NJ",$48K - $65K (Glassdoor est.),-1.0,"Overview

Kanter Auto is seeking an entrepreneurial and data-driven Operations Analyst to join our team. We are recently under new ownership, and our new CEO is focused on modernizing and optimizing our operations to support significant growth. You'll work closely with him to implement new systems, simplify processes, eliminate waste, and build a strong foundation of operational data. You will be given the opportunity to identify and launch projects independently and will have a major impact on our company's performance.

If you want to learn about all the operational aspects of running and growing a high-performance eCommerce business, this is the opportunity for you.

About Kanter Auto

Welcome to our company – an iconic name in the vintage automotive parts and accessories industry for the past sixty years. As of June 2023, we are proud to announce that we are under new ownership, embarking on an exciting new chapter of growth and innovation.

Our legacy as a retailer has been built on providing high-quality parts and unmatched expertise in the classic car market. If you are passionate about operational excellence and want to be part of a company that is dedicated to serving the vintage parts market with renewed energy and vision, come join us on this exciting journey of transformation and advancement. Together, we can shape the future of the aftermarket parts industry.

Who we're looking for:

To be a great fit for this job, you must have:

Previous experience establishing new processes and systems. Previous consulting experience strongly preferred, but not required. (Our new CEO is a previous Accenture consultant and the owner of another successful ecommerce company.)
A data-driven mindset and very strong familiarity with Excel (VLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH). You know how to structure datasets in order to derive insights and solve business problems.
The ability to dive in, analyze the current process, and quickly develop an understanding of how to improve things. You are a very fast learner.
Very strong general familiarity with technology. You do not need to be an expert in warehouse and operational systems, but you need to be very comfortable with learning new systems and doing some configuration yourself. You know what an API is. Netsuite or other ERP knowledge is a plus.
Excellent analytical and process skills. For example, you can set up a lightweight, efficient system to capture weights and dimensions, barcode, and take eCommerce photos for thousands of products that will run well without your constant involvement.

Had you been with us last month, you would have…

Built an Excel model for forecasting inventory purchasing based on data from an old ERP that requires significant analysis to correct the data.
Reviewed our vendors by category and identified critical sourcing projects that must be started.
Assessed our site technology needs (workstations, networking, security) and managed the project from quote through implementation.
Assisted with our Netsuite ERP implementation by gathering data, analyzing current processes to determine requirements, and learning the system.
Received the instruction “we need to barcode our products” and figured out a plan how to make that happen, from beginning to end, for tens of thousands of items.

If you work with us, within the next two years it's likely that you'll:

Lead an assessment project to plan a move to a more modern warehouse facility.
Develop a process to systematically review and process more than 100,000 square feet of vintage auto parts, working with partners in eCommerce and wholesale sales to make them available for sale.
Implement strict inventory control procedures by improving receiving, shipping, and implementing periodic inventory counts.
Set up a large-scale process for capturing product weights, dimensions, and product photography for tens of thousands of products.
Visit other companies to learn about best practices that can be implemented in our facility

Qualities that will make you a good fit for Kanter Auto:

Technology Fluency. You can learn a new application faster than almost anyone around you.
Independence and Efficiency. You get things done faster than your peers and are always improving your execution. You have the right information at your fingertips because you planned in advance. You can independently manage a huge backlog by identifying actions from high-level objectives and prioritizing intelligently. You follow through on all your commitments, on time.
Humility. If it's part of running and building the business, nothing is outside your job description. And that's something you value and appreciate.
Respect. We treat customers, vendors, and each other with tremendous respect and sincere appreciation. They are people first, and business partners second.
Balanced Intensity. You approach your work with intensity, but you're an easy person to be around.
Clear Communication. Clear, concise, and professional written and verbal communication skills. You get your point across effectively and know how to focus on the right things.
