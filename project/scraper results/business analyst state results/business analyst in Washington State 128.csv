Support “fast-buy” workflow for low-risk purchases (i.e. memberships), non-RFP renewal deals (low-dollar), catalog or PunchOut transactions to ensure effective turnaround time is maintained and internal customers and vendors have excellent procurement experience.
Provide regular reporting metrics and monitor various input/output activities (i.e., after the fact POs, number of POs crafted, number of invoices without POs, etc.)
Help drive the continuous improvement of the procurement function; design controls, training, support audits, new hire training and supervise our procurement requirements.
Your Experience
Bachelor’s degree or equivalent experience and minimum 5 years of combined procurement experience
Solid understanding of systems ideally Coupa, Dunn & Bradstreet, DocuSign, Concur, Dynamics etc.
