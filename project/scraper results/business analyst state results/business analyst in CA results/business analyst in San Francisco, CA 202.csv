IT’s Enterprise Data Analytics & Insights (DA&I) org currently owns, develops, and operates two data software services at PG&E. The first service makes it simple for any data consumer across PG&E to gain access to their data, and rapidly generate insights themselves about their operations. The second service helps create, develop, and deliver insights directly to data consumers, who are but not limited to PG&E’s functional areas (FA), e.g., Electric, Gas, and Customer lines of businesses.

You will play a meaningful role in shaping how PG&E’s data investments will serve PG&E’s True North Strategy (TNS).

DA&I Business Architects embody PG&E Virtues, each day we show up and, in every engagement we are present. The role is inherently cross functional. You must become a Trustworthy partner to PG&E’s FAs, working diligently to deliver Business Outcomes. You must be (infinitely!) Curious about how PG&E FAs operate, and Tenacious when helping FAs and our team members succeed. You are a PG&E Owner who must be Nimble and Empathetic, understanding our team will not have all answers immediately, but are committed to continuous improvement as we serve PG&E.

Department Overview
The Digital Strategy team at PG&E oversees the day-to-day operations and strategic roadmap for digital channels including PG&E’s websites, mobile app and notifications platforms. Pge.com is the company’s flagship website. In addition to being a source of information for customers, pge.com is a meaningful customer service channel, giving customers the ability to pay their bill, get usage information and receive text alerts for a variety of situations, from bill reminders and outage updates to bill threshold alerts. The site continues to grow, and currently handles 70M visits and 49M transactions per year. The site is currently being redesigned with a fresh new experience and new technology stack that is expected to go live in late 2023. In addition to pge.com, the team also oversees the PG&E Outage Center, which is a where customers can get status on an outage, view impacted areas on an interactive map, report an outage, or sign up for notifications updates on an existing outage. The team also owns the PG&E Safety & Alert Center which is used for all Public Safety Power Shutoff event communication in 16 languages. Our Report It mobile app is used by customers in high fire threat districts to report non-emergency safety concerns such as tree trimming or a leaning pole. By taking a picture and noting the location, customers can both report and get updates on issues they have submitted. The team also oversees our notification platforms used to provide both crisis communications support and everyday notification updates.

The Digital Strategy team is comprised of 4 main departments: web operations, web product management, compliance and analytics. The web operations team functions like an in-house advertising agency with team members who handle copywriting, design, publishing, project management, site search, SEO and A/B testing. The product management team reviews performance of existing functionality to find optimizations and also writes the product requirements to build new functionality. Compliance keeps a finger on the pulse of the latest privacy and ADA laws, creating documentation and standards to ensure we are managing risk appropriately. Analytics looks at both qualitative (comments) and quantitative (completion rates and traffic) each day to ensure the site can be optimized for the best customer experience. On a daily basis, the team is relentlessly focused on using web site data, customer feedback and troubleshooting tools to understand customer pain points. Once a hypothesis for improvement is identified, the team continuously tests solutions, rolling out winners that improve the customer experience. In addition to operations work, the team also manages and implements a strategic roadmap that reflects industry trends and new features and functionality.

IT’s Enterprise Data Analytics & Insights (DA&I) org currently owns, develops, and operates two data software services at PG&E. The first service makes it simple for any data consumer across PG&E to gain access to their data, and rapidly generate insights themselves about their operations. The second service helps create, develop, and deliver insights directly to data consumers, who are but not limited to PG&E’s functional areas (FA), e.g., Electric, Gas, and Customer lines of businesses. DA&I’s services help FA operators make decisions in PG&E’s public facing programs such as Public Safety Power Shutoff and Enhanced Powerline Safety Settings (EPSS).

Position Summary
DA&I is witnessing unprecedented demand for data services. We are seeking an Expert level, Business Architect (BA) to sit in our DA&I team to support our growth: serving each and all client demands, internal operations, i.e., partnership, functions, and informing investment decisions.

The BA role will play equal parts strategist, product management, and operator. As much as you help define high level, move-forward strategies, you will equally dive into the details. As a BA, you will create high-leverage, business artifacts (Docs, PPTs, Excels, etc.) that are reusable. You will be proactive in identifying and documenting existing business process operations, and inventive in developing what a future state can be. There are no tasks beneath you. You will develop, socialize, and maintain an integrated DA&I Product/Services roadmap that unites clients’ demand(s), with Enterprise Data Management, Enterprise Platforms, and Operation needs. You will play a meaningful role in shaping how PG&E’s data investments will serve PG&E’s True North Strategy (TNS).

DA&I Business Architects embody PG&E Virtues, each day we show up and, in every engagement we are present. The role is inherently cross functional. You must become a Trustworthy partner to PG&E’s FAs, working diligently to deliver Business Outcomes. You must be (infinitely!) Curious about how PG&E FAs operate, and Tenacious when helping FAs and our team members succeed. You are a PG&E Owner who must be Nimble and Empathetic, understanding our team will not have all answers immediately, but are committed to continuous improvement as we serve PG&E.
