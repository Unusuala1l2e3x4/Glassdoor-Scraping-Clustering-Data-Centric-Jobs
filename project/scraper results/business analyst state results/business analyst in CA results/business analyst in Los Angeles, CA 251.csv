What is required is a seamless integration of the tenets of equity and inclusivity into every facet of academic life. If we want our scholars, staff, and students to be able to give their very best, we must create an academic environment that portends success.

Therefore, any applicant seeking to advance the mission of Dornsife College should also be assessed on their capacities beyond the technical elements of their work, and demonstrate an understanding of their impact on others, and to articulate how they contribute positively to those around them.
