You love connecting the dots and can never stop digging. You see a system, technology, widget, doodad, or contraption and you must know everything about it. You must know how it works, how effective it is, how it interacts with other gizmos. Heck, if it is good enough, you want to know how many you can buy. You want to know how it is used and how it can ever be used. This thing may not even exist yet and you want to fully understand it in every possible future.




And you know how to apply your knowledge of numbers to analytical challenges and come up with answers that make sense. You are also patient enough to explain to non-technical people what your numbers mean; this requires charts and graphs and other well thought out graphics that help make sense of your algorithms and equations. Your analysis will matter, and you will need to communicate it to your peers, customers, and history itself.




The bottom line: You are a no-nonsense analyst that looks past the “cool” factor of new systems to see the utility or cost-effectiveness of the newest toys. You use statistical analysis, simulations, predictive modeling, or other methods to analyze information and help decision-makers chose the right course of action.

We integrate science and systems as part of our overall solutioning approach, and we investigate advanced concepts and technologies with disruptive application potential. The sophistication of our work directly reflects the ingenuity and proficiency of our team. Our workforce shapes the future, and our employees are our greatest asset.




What You’ll Do:

All sorts of analysis. You will use sophisticated computer software to analyze and solve problems, this may include the use of statistical software to simulate current and future events and evaluate alternative courses of action. You will work with experts across fields to understand how each of your pieces fits into the bigger picture. Simply put, you will break down problems into their various parts and analyze the effect that different changes and circumstances would have on each of the parts.
