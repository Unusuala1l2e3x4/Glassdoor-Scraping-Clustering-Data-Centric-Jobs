About athenahealth
Here’s our vision: To create a thriving ecosystem that delivers accessible, high-quality, and sustainable healthcare for all.
What’s unique about our locations?
From an historic, 19th century arsenal to a converted, landmark power plant, all of athenahealth’s offices were carefully chosen to represent our innovative spirit and promote the most positive and productive work environment for our teams. Our 10 offices across the United States and India — plus numerous remote employees — all work to modernize the healthcare experience, together.

Our company culture might be our best feature.
We don't take ourselves too seriously. But our work? That’s another story. athenahealth develops and implements products and services that support US healthcare: It’s our chance to create healthier futures for ourselves, for our family and friends, for everyone.

Our vibrant and talented employees — or athenistas, as we call ourselves — spark the innovation and passion needed to accomplish our goal. We continue to expand our workforce with amazing people who bring diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives at every level, and foster an environment where every athenista feels comfortable bringing their best selves to work.

Our size makes a difference, too: We are small enough that your individual contributions will stand out — but large enough to grow your career with our resources and established business stability.

Giving back is integral to our culture. Our athenaGives platform strives to support food security, expand access to high-quality healthcare for all, and support STEM education to develop providers and technologists who will provide access to high-quality healthcare for all in the future. As part of the evolution of athenahealth’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program, we’ve selected nonprofit partners that align with our purpose and let us foster long-term partnerships for charitable giving, employee volunteerism, insight sharing, collaboration, and cross-team engagement.

What can we do for you?
Along with health and financial benefits, athenistas enjoy perks specific to each location, including commuter support, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance, employee resource groups, and collaborative workspaces — some offices even welcome dogs.

In addition to our traditional benefits and perks, we sponsor events throughout the year, including book clubs, external speakers, and hackathons. And we provide athenistas with a company culture based on learning, the support of an engaged team, and an inclusive environment where all employees are valued.

We also encourage a better work-life balance for athenistas with our flexibility. While we know in-office collaboration is critical to our vision, we recognize that not all work needs to be done within an office environment, full-time. With consistent communication and digital collaboration tools, athenahealth enables employees to find a balance that feels fulfilling and productive for each individual situation.
athenahealth is committed to a policy of equal employment opportunity—that’s why we recruit and hire applicants without regard to race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, disability, age, sexual orientation, veteran status, genetic information, gender identity, gender expression, or any other factor prohibited by law.

General Summary:
The Actuarial Development Program (ADP) at Unum has been in existence for over 40 years, and provided guidance and support to hundreds of actuaries early in their careers. Many have built on the foundation provided by the ADP and grown into executive leaders at Unum and across the insurance industry.

Unum's ADP is built around three key elements:


Targeted development of actuarial, financial and leadership skills
Rotational work assignments to promote broad business awareness
Comprehensive exam support towards the pursuit of Fellowship
Each ADP participant has a unique development plan based on their own abilities, experience and career aspirations. Development opportunities are offered in forums including on-the-job training, classroom training, leadership programs, and speaker series. In addition, all ADP participants have frequent interaction with corporate officers.

Roughly every 18 months, ADP participants rotate to a new area of the business to learn a new product or discipline, gain new perspectives, and continue their development as actuaries. Traditional actuarial rotations take place in areas such as pricing, reserve valuation, and claims risk analysis, but some rotations extend well beyond traditional financial roles.

Unum expects ADP participants to make consistent progress towards Fellowship. The exam process is rigorous, and Unum recognizes this by providing significant assistance and rewards to reflect the commitment required. Our Actuarial Education Program provides company-paid study time, covers the cost of textbooks, study guides, preparatory seminars, and exam fees, and offers generous salary increases for each exam passed.

This is an intermediate level position that requires an Associate Actuary Designation (ASA). The candidate to fill this role must have significant technical expertise and relies on increasing business knowledge. While some review by a senior actuary is expected, this individual will take initiative in identifying, researching and analyzing complex issues and concepts. This position will participate in cross-functional initiatives to gain increasing business exposure and knowledge.

This job is responsible for activities surrounding pricing and rate development; overseeing assigned actuarial projects and developing and implementing sound actuarial policies and practices to help Unum meet its financial objectives; providing technical support for other areas such as Product Management & Development, Underwriting & Rating, and Sales. Minimum qualifications include receiving a designation of Associate in the Society of Actuaries, and two to four years of relevant work experience. Generally, there are no direct reports associated with this position.

Principal Duties and Responsibilities

Perform analysis of emerging experience, monitor marketplace and economic trends and review implications.
Support development of analysis framework
Recommend updated pricing, valuation or reserving assumptions
Regularly communicate research findings and analysis to management
Effectively work with any number of other cross functional/operational areas (e.g. underwriting, compliance, customer care) on specific initiatives.
Depending on area assigned, develop pricing or valuation tools, prepare state filings, financial reports and tax returns.
Act as mentor for student actuaries and interns
Prepare routine reports
May perform other duties as assigned

Job Specifications

Bachelors degree required
A designation of Associate in the Society of Actuaries
Desire to attain FSA status
A minimum of two years hands-on experience and in-depth knowledge of business analysis, pricing, valuation, ALM or corporate experience.
Strong problem solving ability and project management skills.
