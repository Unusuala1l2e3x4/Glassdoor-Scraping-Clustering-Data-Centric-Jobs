Accounting Analyst,Momentum Works Financial,United States,$60K (Employer est.),-1.0,"Are you a stellar full charge bookkeeper who's experienced in juggling bookkeeping for multiple small businesses? Do you also want to have fun at work with people you enjoy being around? Are you interested in joining a fast-paced startup with a lot of opportunity for future growth?

If so, this opportunity is for you!

Momentum Works Financial is looking for an exceptional individual to join our small but growing team as a full charge bookkeeper. This position is based in our office in Franklin, Tennessee.

Who Need Not Apply:

If your only experience was in a role unrelated to accounting where you also did some bookkeeping as a peripheral activity, this isn't the role for you. If you've only used some limited functionality in Quickbooks Online, this probably isn't the role for you. This role requires that you demonstrate a depth of experience in both accounting and Quickbooks Online on day 1. It's going to be really awkward for everyone involved if you don't have the skills.

Who We Are:

Momentum Works Financial was started in late 2021 with the intention of helping independent automotive repair shop owners relieve their pain points surrounding bookkeeping. Many shop owners don’t get their financial statements on time, if at all, and their books aren’t kept on true accrual basis. Momentum Works was founded to help resolve these pain points and create a truly painless “plug-and-play” bookkeeping service.

Momentum Works has grown to 20+ clients over the past year with 10+ more on our waiting list. With your help, we can continue to grow and help our clients find freedom! There is an enormous opportunity for growth with the company as we continue to expand. Come join our team and do meaningful work with a fantastic team!

Our Mission:

To build the auto repair industry’s most accurate, consistent, and painless “done-for-me” outsourced accounting experience.

Our Vision:

To see shop owners around the country become financially successful, freeing up their time for the most important things in life.

Our Values:

Accuracy is paramount.
We’re a do-whatever-it-takes company; We go the extra mile to get it right.
We strive for consistent high performance.
We put employees first. Happy employees make happy clients.
Winning is contagious. We win by helping others win.
We are determined to deliver.
We do the right thing.
We consider the customer experience in everything.

As a full charge bookkeeper, you'll:

Work collaboratively as a part of a team to manage bookkeeping activities for up to 25 clients. You’ll work with a Team Lead who will ultimately be responsible for the output your team produces.
Publish documents to Quickbooks Online from our document management software.
Clear bank feeds in Quickbooks Online
Enter bank deposits, checks, bills, vendor payments, journal entries, etc.
Submit payroll, perform payroll entries and payroll accrual.
Enter daily sales from clients’ point of sale systems.
Reconcile sales to clients’ POS monthly.
Reconcile credit card and bank accounts monthly.
Reconcile vendor statements, and manage vendor balances.
Regularly interact with clients to obtain necessary information and source documents.
Analyze P&L and Balance Sheet to identify and correct issues.
We're a ""do whatever it takes"" company, so there may be times you'll be asked to chip in on work that's outside of your primary job responsibilities. As a fast-growing startup, this just comes with the territory.

We're looking for someone who is:

Experienced. Two to five years of bookkeeping experience – public accounting experience preferred (i.e. CPA firms or other bookkeeping firms serving multiple client engagements).
Problem-solver. Top-notch problem-solving skills – This is the number one most important skill a bookkeeper must have! Bookkeeping really is more about figuring things out than the actual math.
Self-starter. Absolutely must be able to do whatever it takes to learn what we're doing and hit the ground running. You'll have plenty of resources at your fingertips, but the rest will be up to you. Bonus points for making us better with your wealth of accounting experience.
Experience and understanding of Accrual based accounting is a must.
Knowledgeable. You must have an excellent understanding of accounting & bookkeeping best practices (GAAP). The ideal candidate has a degree in accounting or a closely related field such as finance, business or economics, though this isn't strictly required. Being a QBO ProAdvisor is a plus, but not required.
Highly organized. This role will require you to juggle the needs and deadlines of more than a handful of clients. We have all the software to support you in your role to make you as efficient as possible.
Ethical. The work we do requires the highest levels of ethics and integrity. The right candidate is doing the right thing even when no one's looking.
Fun. Yes, we like to enjoy ourselves. We have a good time while getting the job done. The right person for this position will be able to ""click"" with our culture.
Great at building strong, personal relationships. You will be closely interacting with your clients. It's important that you establish a personal rapport with your clients and become a trusted advisor.
Detail-oriented. Attention to detail with an exceptional level of accuracy – We will only be giving interviews to applicants who answer the following question: “What superpower do you bring to the teams you’re on?” Please use the word “superpower” and put your answer in the “Additional Comments” section at the end of the application. This ensures that you read the entire job description and you value detail like us.
A solid understanding of financials. You’ll work with a Team Lead who will have more depth of understanding on the P&L and Balance Sheet, but having the ability to recognize problems, even if you don’t know exactly how to fix them, is essential. You’ll have lots of experienced team members to pull from.
Must be techy with solid knowledge of computers and various software and apps
Excellent written and verbal communication skills to show confidence and professionalism.
Flexible. The way that we'll be doing things is specifically geared to the needs of the niche we serve. This will require you to be flexible in your approach to doing the job, and it's very important that you are ""on board"" with our approach.
An adaptable, fast learner. Every client has unique requirements, so each one is a learning experience. We need someone who's not afraid to jump in and figure it out.
Quickbooks Online: Must have experience with Journal Entries, Bank Feeds, bank and credit card reconciliations, A/P, P&L and Balance Sheet review.

Why join Momentum Works:

Our company is still very small, but we have big plans and you can be in a position to grow with us!
Do work that matters. We're not just keeping books, we're helping real people succeed in their businesses.
Competitive compensation, along with paid time off, retirement plan, and full medical, dental, and vision benefits.

Investment Banking Outreach Analyst,"Benchmark International
","Nashville, TN",$52K - $78K (Employer est.),3.9,"Benchmark International is now looking for business professionals to fill entry-level roles on its sell-side mergers and acquisitions teams. The US Headquarters in Tampa, FL was founded in 2013. Since then, we have opened offices in Austin, TX and Nashville, TN where numerous analysts have been promoted to associate roles.

Our analysts begin learning negotiation skills, valuation metrics, and the entire M&A process from their first day on the job. They engage clients and potential acquirers on a daily basis; generating buyer interest in our clients, negotiating the terms of non-disclosure agreements, and initiating the response to the buyer’s due diligence investigation into their team’s portfolio of businesses for sale.

This is a role requiring the ability to hold your own against business owners, private equity associates, and business development professionals from Fortune 500 companies. You will work on multiple files, across a variety of industries, every day. As an entry-level position, you will not be expected to have any particular M&A knowledge but must have a keen interest in growing your knowledge-base in this exciting field of business. All aspects of the company sale process will unfold on the trading floor within easy earshot of your workstation. As you gain experience, your involvement and responsibilities will progress further through the process. As there is more than enough work to go around on our teams, those with the interest and ability will be given additional responsibilities on a case-by-case basis after first proving their ability to go toe-to-toe with the various constituencies involved in the process and come out with favorable results for our clients.

Our deal teams have been closing between one and two transactions per month over the last several years. They rely on their analysts to continually restock the pool of interested buyers in order to continue that success.

Client origination, general firm marketing, and similar operational distractions are taken off the teams’ plates, keeping to Benchmark International’s model. This allows a more focused approach on operations and portfolio management. The teams’ obligations regarding each client commence with a signed engagement letter and detailed file, prepared by the separate Deal Origination Department, and continue through every aspect of the transaction (other than legal and accounting services) to the closing and collection of the resulting success fee.

Job Responsibilities

Analysts will work together in pairs, under the direct supervision of an associate serving in the role of Senior Deal Associate. The role of the Senior Deal Associate serves as the next logical step in the analyst’s advancement and they will thus have clear visibility into future potential career opportunities. Your specific duties as an analyst will include:

Developing and building relationships with Benchmark International’s clients (business owners pursuing the sale of their business) and pool of potential acquirers for those businesses. This is a front-line role involving frequent communication with seller-clients and buyers, primarily via phone and email.
Managing early stages of each acquirer-seller relationship from introduction to preliminary negotiations including (i) performing research to uncover potential companies and individuals interested in acquiring businesses owned by Benchmark’s clients, (ii) reaching out to potential acquirers via phone and email, (iii) managing client’s profiles on third party and proprietary online portals and responding to inquiries on such portals, (iv) negotiating nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) with potential acquirers, (v) preparing executed NDAs and acquirer profiles for clients, (vi) obtaining clients’ approval of NDA’s and potential acquirers’ access to client’s marketing materials which contain sensitive business data, (vii) fielding approved potential acquirers’ additional questions about clients, replying where possible and seeking additional data from clients where required, (vii) arranging meetings and conference calls between clients and acquirers, occasionally moderating such calls, (vii) following up on conference calls and on site visits, and (viii) driving approved potential acquirers to submit offers for clients’ businesses.
Developing relationships with private equity funds, venture capital funds, family offices, and active trade buyers.
Assisting associates in preparation and revision of clients’ marketing materials, primarily through requesting additional information from clients and assembling lists of potential acquirers.
Filing and keeping Benchmark International’s networked customer resource management system up-to-date for all of the above.
Communicating effectively with clients by phone and electronic means to obtain client information and convey results of analysis.
Researching industries and M&A market segments.
Preparing reports of findings, illustrating data graphically, and translating complex findings into written text.

Job Requirements

As an analyst, you must be a highly energetic and passionate individual with a positive and highly motivated can-do attitude. You must have the strong desire and ambition to succeed in this rewarding industry. It is also vital for your role as an analyst that you possess excellent verbal and written communication, analytical, mathematical, and interpersonal skills, as well as presentation abilities.

Our analysts deal only with existing clients. As a client-facing role, each analyst must be able to convey bad news and deal with clients' unique sensitivities while keeping each client moving through the company sales process at a steady pace.

Specific qualifications for the Deal Analyst include:

Experienced in professional business writing.
Prioritization and organization skills.
Proficiency in Word, Outlook, and Excel.
Communication skills: written and verbal; delivering information in an empathetic, yet persuasive manner.
Proficiency with online research including proprietary sources such as Hoovers, IBISWorld, DealNexus, PrivCo, Corpfin, Pitchbook, OneSource, and First Research.
Commercial understanding and awareness of business.
Possession of a valid and current driver license.
Associate degree (A.A.) or higher preferred, one-year related experience and/or training; or equivalent combination of education and experience.
Ability to consistently present yourself in a professional manner in keeping with Benchmark International's image (as shown, for example, on the company's web site).
Availability and willingness to work outside normal business hours at times, whether early or late, as required by client schedules and expectations.
Availability and willingness to travel for occasional overnight trips on short notice (rarely, if ever, longer than two days).
Ability to obtain a Florida real-estate sales associate license within 90 days of employment (For employment in our Florida office).
Ability to obtain a Texas real-estate sales associate license within 7 months of employment (For employment in our Texas office).
Ability to obtain a Tennessee real-estate sales associate license within 90 days of employment (For employment in our Tennessee office).
Absence of any unfavorable history with FINRA, the SEC, or any state regulatory agency.
Must be able to work in the office each and every day as this is not a remote or hybrid position.

Compensation

Analysts receive a bi-weekly salary in the range of $42,500 to $52,500 and commissions equal to a percentage of revenue obtained from closing transactions with an additional end-of-year bonus if the team's target is achieved. As a result, overall compensation can vary from year to year based on success and on target performance could result in total compensation in the range of $51,500 - $78,375.

Benefits

All Benchmark International positions offer paid time off, standard holidays, and community service days. Employees are eligible for highly competitive company-subsidized medical, dental, vision, and AD&D insurance; 401k with company matching; flexible spending accounts; and flexible dependent care assistance accounts. Quarterly team outings and standing desks are employee favorites at present.

Social Responsibility

Benchmark International is an active, contributing member of the communities in which we work. The company participates in significant charitable giving opportunities throughout the year. Many of the recipient charities have been identified by our individual employees as a result of their personal passions for supporting particular needs. In addition, each employee is encouraged to use two paid work days per year to provide their labor and skills to the community.

The US Headquarters in Tampa, FL was founded in 2013. Since then, we have opened offices in Austin, TX and Nashville, TN where numerous analysts have been promoted to associate roles.

Our analysts begin learning negotiation skills, valuation metrics, and the entire M&A process from their first day on the job. They engage clients and potential acquirers on a daily basis; generating buyer interest in our clients, negotiating the terms of non-disclosure agreements, and initiating the response to the buyer’s due diligence investigation into their team’s portfolio of businesses for sale.

This is a role requiring the ability to hold your own against business owners, private equity associates, and business development professionals from Fortune 500 companies. You will work on multiple files, across a variety of industries, every day. As an entry-level position, you will not be expected to have any particular M&A knowledge but must have a keen interest in growing your knowledge-base in this exciting field of business. All aspects of the company sale process will unfold on the trading floor within easy earshot of your workstation. As you gain experience, your involvement and responsibilities will progress further through the process. As there is more than enough work to go around on our teams, those with the interest and ability will be given additional responsibilities on a case-by-case basis after first proving their ability to go toe-to-toe with the various constituencies involved in the process and come out with favorable results for our clients.

Our deal teams have been closing between one and two transactions per month over the last several years. They rely on their analysts to continually restock the pool of interested buyers in order to continue that success.

Client origination, general firm marketing, and similar operational distractions are taken off the teams’ plates, keeping to Benchmark International’s model. This allows a more focused approach on operations and portfolio management.

General Summary:
The Actuarial Development Program (ADP) at Unum has been in existence for over 40 years, and provided guidance and support to hundreds of actuaries early in their careers. Many have built on the foundation provided by the ADP and grown into executive leaders at Unum and across the insurance industry.

Unum's ADP is built around three key elements:


Targeted development of actuarial, financial and leadership skills
Rotational work assignments to promote broad business awareness
Comprehensive exam support towards the pursuit of Fellowship
Each ADP participant has a unique development plan based on their own abilities, experience and career aspirations. Development opportunities are offered in forums including on-the-job training, classroom training, leadership programs, and speaker series. In addition, all ADP participants have frequent interaction with corporate officers.

Roughly every 18 months, ADP participants rotate to a new area of the business to learn a new product or discipline, gain new perspectives, and continue their development as actuaries. Traditional actuarial rotations take place in areas such as pricing, reserve valuation, and claims risk analysis, but some rotations extend well beyond traditional financial roles.

Unum expects ADP participants to make consistent progress towards Fellowship. The exam process is rigorous, and Unum recognizes this by providing significant assistance and rewards to reflect the commitment required. Our Actuarial Education Program provides company-paid study time, covers the cost of textbooks, study guides, preparatory seminars, and exam fees, and offers generous salary increases for each exam passed.
