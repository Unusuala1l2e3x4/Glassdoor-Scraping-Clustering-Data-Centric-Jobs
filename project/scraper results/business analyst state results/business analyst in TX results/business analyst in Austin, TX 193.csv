The posted salary range budgeted for this position is between $5,521.58 and $7,288.58 monthly.

The COR 22-033 LIDDA EDI Enhancements Project will develop an electronic data interface (EDI) between the LIDDA and the Long-Term Care Online Portal.

LIDDAs provide service coordination to individuals with IDD in the community and in some Medicaid waiver programs. Each LIDDA chooses their systems and software to complete assessments, develop services plans, and store documentation. There is not an electronic data interface (EDI) with the state’s LTC portal and LIDDA’s systems. As a result, service coordinators who enter information in the LIDDA’s system must manually enter the same information in the state’s LTC portal. Funds will be distributed in grants to LIDDAs to allow them to build an EDI with the LTC portal, gaining efficiencies as dual entry into multiple systems will no longer be necessary. State resources are allocated in an existing project to build the EDI in the state’s LTC portal. The development of an EDI will reduce manual work for service coordinators, creating efficiencies in their work processes and allowing staff more time to work directly with the clients they serve.
