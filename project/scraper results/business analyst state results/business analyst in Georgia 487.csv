Why work at one company when you could work with almost every company to solve the world’s biggest problems? At Deloitte, you can work across industries, technologies, and sectors, with people from every corner of the world. So don't just work in tech, healthcare, finance, or retail. Work everywhere — right here at Deloitte.


Work You’ll Do


As a Business Technology Solutions Analyst, you will be an integral member of a client service team, working directly with the client and Deloitte leaders to help solve multidimensional business problems, improve performance, and generate value for our clients across a broad base of industries. You will support strategic business transformation through the application of technology to our clients’ most complex problems, including examples such as: standing up cloud infrastructure, automating a business process using AI, design and implement data and analytic solutions as part of a DevOps team, designing innovative experiences for digital commerce using market leading platforms, helping to manage the deployment for a global-scale implementation for business and IT transformation, or developing, architecting, and implementing a technology strategy to support executive-level business objectives. You can capitalize on our cross-industry presence within our market offerings to have a wide breadth of experience, or to find a niche that’s just right for you.

While a career in consulting is dynamic and evolving, each client engagement requires skills in specific areas. Setting our people up for success to deliver outstanding impact to our clients is our highest priority. We recognize that you have unique skills, experiences, and interests, so we divide the broad scope of the Analyst role into skills-based profiles in order to best align each Analyst with a starting focus area. These profiles include alignment to market leading solutions and skillsets including: Data Engineering, Data Science Enablement, Cloud, Quality Engineering, Digital Commerce, Salesforce, Product Management, Quality Engineering, Supply Chain, Oracle and SAP.

All Business Technology Solutions Analysts develop recommendations that optimize the use of technology within an organization, applying strategic technology solutions. We are looking for someone who can move fluidly across both business and IT stakeholders, understanding both the business and applying analytical skills to help clients take advantage of growth opportunities through the adoption of technology. In addition to an understanding of business technology solutions, this person should be a keen observer and learner and should have strong analytical and critical thinking skills with the ability to solve complex problems and communicate findings.


The Team


Our Deloitte Consulting team plays a major role in directly embedding technology insights into our clients’ organizational goals. At Deloitte, our consultants create sharply-focused solutions within an organization’s operating model, accounting for its people, intellectual capital, technology, and processes. Engagement teams at Deloitte drive value for our clients but also understand the importance of developing resources and contributing to the communities in which we work. We make it our business to take issue to impact, both within and beyond a client setting.

The Actuarial Development Program (ADP) at Unum has been in existence for over 40 years, and provided guidance and support to hundreds of actuaries early in their careers. Many have built on the foundation provided by the ADP and grown into executive leaders at Unum and across the insurance industry.

Unum's ADP is built around three key elements:


Targeted development of actuarial, financial and leadership skills
Rotational work assignments to promote broad business awareness
Comprehensive exam support towards the pursuit of Fellowship
Each ADP participant has a unique development plan based on their own abilities, experience and career aspirations. Development opportunities are offered in forums including on-the-job training, classroom training, leadership programs, and speaker series. In addition, all ADP participants have frequent interaction with corporate officers.

Roughly every 18 months, ADP participants rotate to a new area of the business to learn a new product or discipline, gain new perspectives, and continue their development as actuaries. Traditional actuarial rotations take place in areas such as pricing, reserve valuation, and claims risk analysis, but some rotations extend well beyond traditional financial roles.

Unum expects ADP participants to make consistent progress towards Fellowship. The exam process is rigorous, and Unum recognizes this by providing significant assistance and rewards to reflect the commitment required. Our Actuarial Education Program provides company-paid study time, covers the cost of textbooks, study guides, preparatory seminars, and exam fees, and offers generous salary increases for each exam passed.

This is an intermediate level position, which requires increasing technical expertise and decision making. This individual will begin to identify issues and begin participating in project work primarily within the functional area, with mentoring from senior actuaries. Minimum qualifications include passing 4 actuarial exams and having a minimum of 12 months relevant experience. There are no direct reports associated with this position.

Principal Duties and Responsibilities

Prepare and analyze complex data for use in actuarial experience studies, valuation, or pricing projects
Provide significant support for development of pricing and underwriting tools
Develop reserve factors, analyze reserves and monitor reserve changes
Develop experience analysis reviews
Support maintenance of valuation system

Provide increasing support for underwriting case specific questions
Contribute to product development and repricing initiatives
Begin working with product, underwriting, compliance, risk management, investments and other areas on specific initiatives; communicate project status within functional area
Support preparation of state filing packages
Assist in training interns and entry level student actuaries
Prepare routine reports
Expected to pursue membership in the Society of Actuaries through the examination process
