Starting in rural America. Today, 60 million Americans living in rural communities are facing a crisis of access to care. In the U.S. healthcare system, rural Americans experience significantly poorer clinical outcomes. This trend is rapidly accelerating as rural hospitals close and physician shortages increase, exacerbating health disparities. In fact, Americans living in rural communities suffer a mortality rate 23 percent higher than those in urban communities, in part because of the lack of access to quality care.

Our vision is care that enables everyone to achieve their best health. So, we're rearchitecting the way it's delivered – leveraging breakthroughs in diagnostics, remote monitoring, and a variety of other domains, Homeward is creating a new healthcare delivery model that is purpose-built for rural America and directly addresses the issues that have historically limited access and quality.

Most importantly, we're aligning everyone's incentives (ours, partner health plans', and members') towards getting and keeping people healthy by taking full responsibility and financial risk for the total cost of each member's healthcare and outcomes.

Homeward is co-founded by a leadership team that defined and delivered Livongo's products, and backed most recently by a $50 million series B co-led by Arch Ventures and Human Capital, with participation from General Catalyst for a total of $70 million in funding.

Design and implement workflows for ingestion and transformation for various data sources
Work with a modern data engineering stack - some pieces of ours include Airbyte, Snowflake, and Metabase.

What you bring:

5+ years of hands-on data engineering experience in a healthcare setting
Bachelor's degree in computer science, computer engineering or a related technical discipline or equivalent industry experience.
You have in-depth experience working with data warehouses (preferably Snowflake) and relational databases (preferably Postgres)
You have real-world experience working with data in FHIR and HL7 standards
You have a healthy understanding of security and PHI, especially where it interacts with HIPAA regulations. You internalize that security is a first-order priority and evangelize this position to others through implementation and documentation.
You have experience with structuring and permissioning data in data lakes / marts to make data available on a role-specific basis
You are comfortable working with a variety of data formats as part of a data ingestion pipeline (we primarily deal with CSV and Parquet files)
You have implemented infrastructure in a cloud environment, preferably AWS

"Associate, Data Engineer","Vestwell
","Austin, TX",$90K - $105K (Employer est.),3.7,"Who Are We?

There are over 30M small businesses in the United States, but only a tiny fraction of them have a workplace savings program in place. As the savings gap in the country widens, it's imperative that every worker has access to and participates in their company's savings program, such as a 401(k) or 403(b). We believe that American workers should have easy access to an inexpensive, flexible, and intuitive solution to save for a brighter future.

Unfortunately, prior to Vestwell, small businesses have been neglected and underserved, with expensive, inflexible, poorly designed offerings built on old, mainframe software. Vestwell is changing that, starting with rebuilding the core infrastructure for the modern era.

Vestwell's north star is to be the engine behind a $30T industry, powering all payroll-deducted workplace savings programs for small-to-midsize businesses, such as 401(k), 403(b), IRA, emergency savings accounts (ESA), health savings accounts (HSA), 529 college savings, and alike.

Vestwell's focus is to build the most flexible, powerful workplace savings and investment platform, delivered through the hands and minds of their financial services partners with the help of payroll provider partners. The team at Vestwell makes the hard stuff look easy, by combining the expertise of financial advice with the sophistication of a technology provider.

As a result, workplace providers are able to bestow the advice and solution employers and employees have been asking for, while growing and scaling along the way. Employers get a cost-effective solution designed for their needs without all the headaches, and employees get a user-friendly portal that helps them achieve their long-term saving goals.

Why Vestwell?

With backing from leading FinTech investors, as well as a growing team of dedicated professionals of strong industry pedigree, Vestwell is at the forefront of a much-needed change in a 40-year old industry. Our team believes in the mission we've set out to achieve and we are working hard to get there. We're ambitious, honest, thoughtful, and fun.

WHO ARE WE LOOKING FOR?

The Engineering team is seeking an Associate Data Engineer, eager to learn and grow in our data landscape. You should be enthusiastic about the world of data, willing to contribute to our Reporting stack, and excited to partner with more experienced engineers to deepen your knowledge and skills.

You're a great fit for our team if you're curious, committed, and eager to learn. While you might not have vast experience yet, your passion for data engineering and its potential impact stands out. That's what we value the most.

Day to day, you may additionally…

Assist in maintaining our data pipeline architecture
Help in assembling data sets that meet both functional and non-functional business requirements.
Support the creation of infrastructure required for data extraction, loading, and transformation from various data sources
Contribute to analytics tools that leverage the data warehouse to provide insights into business performance metrics
Collaborate with stakeholders including the Executive, Product, and Operations teams to assist in their data infrastructure needs
Receive training and guidance from senior engineers and participate in code reviews to further your development skills
