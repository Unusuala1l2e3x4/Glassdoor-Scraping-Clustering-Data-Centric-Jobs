The AWS Core Networking Organization is looking for a Software Development Engineer to join our Network Data Modelling Services (NDMS) team. Our Software Development Engineers design smart adaptive algorithms that react intelligently to real-world events. We develop software at every level of the stack from front-end user interfaces to low-level embedded software and everything in between.

Virtualization, incredible scale, hardware commoditization, and automation are revolutionizing networking and network software. In AWS Networking, we leverage big data technologies and analytics software to run one of the largest networks in the world. We push the boundaries of robustness, fault-tolerance and smart adaptive algorithms that can react intelligently to real-world events. This is your time to make history by building large-scale distributed software systems.

The AWS network is composed of millions of heterogeneous network devices, all of which need to be managed in a consistent manner, abstracted away from platform-specific differences, and reduced in complexity for our customers. NEST(Network Expansion Systems and Tools) team has an exciting charter to provide scalable platform services for building authoritative data services for the Amazon Network. This team is also responsible for designing and scaling services across AWS network devices, interfaces and links. We are the primary source of network link state data and our team offers a set of services and APIs which work in tandem to share this authoritative view with the core services needed to run the AWS network.

Do you believe that good systems design is about looking around corners and designing to scale? Are you passionate about using technology to solve problems that have a huge impact?

Come build the future of networking at AWS

1. How big is the team and what are some examples of member backgrounds?
We are a two pizza team comprised of Software engineers with experience in diverse domains : finance, cloud services, eCommerce and retail. The team has a mix of tenured engineers and more recent hires.
2. Is the team cross functional or primarily SDEs? If so, what other roles engage with the team?
We are a majority of SDEs, TPM and PMT. The SDEs have ownership of feature delivery, architecture design/scalability and code quality and owners of operations. Where as TPM manages the technical program and PMT manages the customer engagement, roadmap of the product.
3. Why should I join this team and how will the work add value to my experience in future?
We are the authoritative source of link state for one of the largest networks in the world. On this team you will tackle challenges around data quality, scale, networking technology, distributed systems and much more. The services owned by this team are central to the AWS network, so you will also have significant visibility and many opportunities to make far-reaching impact.
4. Does this team work purely on legacy code and to what extent do they use OO languages?
SDEs on our team split their time between new feature development and managing existing services, 50/50 on average. The languages we use are almost holistically OO (Java primarily) and Native AWS Services.
