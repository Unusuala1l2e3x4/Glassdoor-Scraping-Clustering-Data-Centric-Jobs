to join our dynamic team!
The ideal candidate will have a proven track record in integrating diverse systems, implementing robust data strategies, and a solid understanding of the Vista database.



This role interfaces with multiple teams & projects -

we’re eager to meet our newest team member!

JH Kelly, LLC is a fourth-generation, family-owned regional construction company in its 100th year with offices in Vancouver, Longview, Seattle, Bellingham, Washington, and Milwaukie, Oregon. We provide services to a commercial and heavy industrial client base and are recognized as an industry leader.

Our exceptional team is made up of talented individuals whose ability to plan and execute challenging projects has resulted in a loyal customer following and national safety & quality control awards. Our integrated project approach includes self-performing concrete placement, steel erection, carpentry, equipment setting, millwrighting, plumbing, pipefitting, sheet metal, electrical & instrumentation services, and servicing the completed building.

JH Kelly is a great place to work in a fun, dynamic, and family-oriented environment. We offer an excellent benefits package and competitive wages. Learn more about us at www.jhkelly.com

Summary:

The rapid evolution of technology offers exciting opportunities for individuals seeking challenging and meaningful careers. Conversely, it’s no secret that careers in this field are sometimes associated with isolation, silos, and the risk of hitting dead ends.

At JH Kelly, we approach technology differently. Rather than developing products for sale, we are integrating our systems along a robust data strategy to drive faster and more profitable business decisions. We are the customer. As such, we challenge our teams to diversify their skill sets and follow their passions, firmly believing that people who are doing what they are genuinely interested in are more innovative than those toiling away in obscurity on one small part of a larger project.

At the core of our data strategy is our ERP, Vista by Viewpoint. We utilize SQL, SSIS, SSAS, and Tabular Editor to extract data from Vista and our propriety Project Control System to create the core of our Data Warehouse. From that, we leverage Power BI not only to create a traditional look-back reporting but to aggregate our data “over time” and project the future outcome of our Construction Projects. Our vision is to combine information from our Safety, Estimating, Design, and Supply Chain platforms with this data, in a Data Lake, providing end-to-end visibility on all primary processes within our Construction Operations.

Joining the JH Kelly team requires a dynamic and proactive mindset. As part of our Development Team, you will be directly interacting with our C-Suite on iterative projects, proof of concepts, and multi-year road maps. You will be challenged with complex problems with the freedom to develop solutions. You will work closely with our cross-functional Development Teams to design, develop, and maintain data pipelines, models, and analytics solutions that serve our Operational Teams.

If you have a strong foundational knowledge of the Vista database as a Data Engineer or Data Scientist and are ready for a new challenge, this may be the opportunity you are looking for.

Key Responsibilities:

Collaborate with business stakeholders to understand data requirements and objectives.
Design, develop, and maintain ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes and data pipelines.
Utilize Vista by Viewpoint to extract, transform, and load data from various sources into our data lake or data warehouse.
Develop and maintain data models and analytics solutions.
Perform data analysis, data cleansing, and data transformation as needed.
Ensure data quality and accuracy through data validation and testing.
Create and implement data governance policies and best practices.
Stay up-to-date with industry trends and emerging technologies in data engineering and data science.

Qualifications:

Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Data Science, or a related field.
Proven experience as a Data Engineer, Data Scientist, or similar role.
Proficiency in Vista by Viewpoint and its associated data structures.
Strong programming skills in languages such as Python, SQL, or Java.
Familiarity with data warehousing concepts and technologies.
Experience with ETL tools and data integration processes.
Knowledge of data modeling and analytics techniques.
Excellent problem-solving and communication skills.
Ability to work effectively in a team and independently.

Preferred Qualifications:

Familiarity with cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
Knowledge of data visualization tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI).
Certifications related to data engineering or data science.

We do this by building and running the world's best data and AI infrastructure platform so our customers can use deep data insights to improve their business. Founded by engineers — and customer obsessed — we leap at every opportunity to solve technical challenges, from designing next-gen UI/UX for interfacing with data to scaling our services and infrastructure across millions of virtual machines. And we're only getting started.

Modern data analysis employs sophisticated methods such as machine learning that go well beyond the roll-up and drill-down capabilities of traditional SQL query engines. As a software engineer on the Runtime team at Databricks, you will be building the next generation distributed data storage and processing systems that can outperform specialized SQL query engines in relational query performance, yet provide the expressiveness and programming abstractions to support diverse workloads ranging from ETL to data science.

Software Engineer (Data Platform),Phaidra,"Seattle, WA",$87K - $148K (Employer est.),-1.0,"About Phaidra

Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.

The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.

Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:

We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions.
We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning.
We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.

Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.

Phaidra is based in the USA but 100% remote; we do not have a physical office. We hire employees internationally with the help of our partner, OysterHR. Our team is currently located throughout the USA, Canada, UK, Norway, Italy, Portugal, and India.

At Databricks, we are obsessed with enabling data teams to solve the world's toughest problems, from security threat detection to cancer drug development. We do this by building and running the world's best data and AI infrastructure platform, so our customers can focus on the high value challenges that are central to their own missions.

Founded in 2013 by the original creators of Apache Spark, Databricks has grown from a tiny corner office in Berkeley, California to a global organization with over 1000 employees. Thousands of organizations, from small to Fortune 100, trust Databricks with their mission-critical workloads, making us one of the fastest growing SaaS companies in the world.

Our engineering teams build highly technical products that fulfill real, important needs in the world. We constantly push the boundaries of data and AI technology, while simultaneously operating with the resilience, security and scale that is critical to making customers successful on our platform.

We develop and operate one of the largest scale software platforms. The fleet consists of millions of virtual machines, generating terabytes of logs and processing exabytes of data per day. At our scale, we regularly observe cloud hardware, network, and operating system faults, and our software must gracefully shield our customers from any of the above.

Modern data analysis employs sophisticated methods such as machine learning that go well beyond the roll-up and drill-down capabilities of traditional SQL query engines. As a software engineer on the Runtime team at Databricks, you will be building the next generation distributed data storage and processing systems that can outperform specialized SQL query engines in relational query performance, yet provide the expressiveness and programming abstractions to support diverse workloads ranging from ETL to data science.

Below are some example projects:

Apache Spark: Develop the de facto open source standard framework for big data.

Data Plane Storage: Deliver reliable and high performance services and client libraries for storing and accessing humongous amount of data on cloud storage backends, e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Store.

Delta Lake: A storage management system that combines the scale and cost-efficiency of data lakes, the performance and reliability of a data warehouse, and the low latency of streaming. Its higher level abstractions and guarantees, including ACID transactions and time travel, drastically simplify the complexity of real-world data engineering architecture.

Delta Pipelines: It's difficult to manage even a single data engineering pipeline. The goal of the Delta Pipelines project is to make it simple and possible to orchestrate and operate tens of thousands of data pipelines. It provides a higher level abstraction for expressing data pipelines and enables customers to deploy, test & upgrade pipelines and eliminate operational burdens for managing and building high quality data pipelines.

Performance Engineering: Build the next generation query optimizer and execution engine that's fast, tuning free, scalable, and robust.

What we look for:

BS in Computer Science, related technical field or equivalent practical experience.
Optional: MS or PhD in databases, distributed systems.
Comfortable working towards a multi-year vision with incremental deliverables.
Driven by delivering customer value and impact.
5+ years of production level experience in either Java, Scala or C++.

Engineering culture

At MAQ Software, we foster a strong engineering culture with a can-do attitude. Our key managers come from excellent educational backgrounds and have significant experience in growing a company and mentoring software engineers. Due to our smaller size, we are agile and able to adopt the latest technologies and computing trends ahead of larger industry players.

As a part of our globally distributed engineering team, our engineers gain exposure to the latest software engineering practices and fast development cycles, providing them with the opportunity to work on challenging technical problems that utilize cutting-edge technologies for fast-paced software delivery. Our collaborative and supportive work environment encourages innovation and growth, making our company an exciting and rewarding place to work.

Examples of some of our projects:

We built an analytics platform for a leading fintech company using Azure services, enabling them to scale to 1000+ customers and provide self-service, near real-time analytics. Our solution, based on Azure Synapse, Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, and Power BI, followed the best practices of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, and leveraged migration strategies from Microsoft’s Cloud Adoption Framework. Our automated deployment framework reduced setup time from days to hours. The platform now offers powerful self-service analytics, enabling their customers to reach millions of borrowers faster and easily integrate machine learning models for innovation.

We helped an organic supermarket chain migrate to Microsoft Power BI and Azure Synapse to improve their reporting and data analytics capabilities. The previous system was time-consuming, error-prone, and offered limited visualization and self-service capabilities. With the new solution, the client can now perform direct queries between front-end Power BI reports and back-end data, enabling real-time insights and a holistic view across teams. Azure Synapse also provides higher data security. The migration resulted in automatic report generation, reduced operational costs, increased ROI, and better business decisions.

We developed a chatbot for the Arizona Department of Economic Security (DES) to improve its Program Service Evaluator (PSE) training. The chatbot used Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services to answer PSE questions based on the policy manual of various state benefit programs. The chatbot learned from user feedback and crawled the policy content automatically. The chatbot increased evaluation efficiency, reduced senior staff time, and provided conversational responses to PSEs. The chatbot integrated seamlessly into the PSEs’ workflow and was accessible through a web interface and Skype for Business.

Our client, a leader in the energy and utilities sector, needed a scalable solution to analyze large volumes of IoT data from diverse applications. We used Power BI and Azure Data Explorer (ADX) to ingest, transform, and visualize semi-structured JSON data from network logs. Our solution reduced the data refresh time, handled dynamic schema changes, and enabled comprehensive analysis using Direct Query mode. Our client gained real-time insights and a competitive edge in the industry with our robust and effective solution. The solution also facilitated efficient data ingestion and transformation, effectively tackled issues pertaining to data refresh and dynamic schema of data.

We helped a multinational food and beverage chain to improve its sales forecasting accuracy by building a hybrid machine learning model on Azure Databricks. The model used historical sales, weather, and event data to predict future sales and analyze the impact of various factors on sales. The model also detected and explained seasonal and daily spikes and lag periods. Our model reduced the MAPE value from 0.13 to 0.09 and enabled the client to make better business decisions.

Inc. magazine has recognized us for sustained growth by listing us on the Inc. 5000 list eleven times – a rare honor.

Engineering culture

At MAQ Software, we foster a strong engineering culture with a can-do attitude. Our key managers come from excellent educational backgrounds and have significant experience in growing a company and mentoring software engineers. Due to our smaller size, we are agile and able to adopt the latest technologies and computing trends ahead of larger industry players.

As a part of our globally distributed engineering team, our engineers gain exposure to the latest software engineering practices and fast development cycles, providing them with the opportunity to work on challenging technical problems that utilize cutting-edge technologies for fast-paced software delivery. Our collaborative and supportive work environment encourages innovation and growth, making our company an exciting and rewarding place to work.

Examples of some of our projects:

We built an analytics platform for a leading fintech company using Azure services, enabling them to scale to 1000+ customers and provide self-service, near real-time analytics. Our solution, based on Azure Synapse, Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, and Power BI, followed the best practices of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, and leveraged migration strategies from Microsoft’s Cloud Adoption Framework. Our automated deployment framework reduced setup time from days to hours. The platform now offers powerful self-service analytics, enabling their customers to reach millions of borrowers faster and easily integrate machine learning models for innovation.

We helped an organic supermarket chain migrate to Microsoft Power BI and Azure Synapse to improve their reporting and data analytics capabilities. The previous system was time-consuming, error-prone, and offered limited visualization and self-service capabilities. With the new solution, the client can now perform direct queries between front-end Power BI reports and back-end data, enabling real-time insights and a holistic view across teams. Azure Synapse also provides higher data security. The migration resulted in automatic report generation, reduced operational costs, increased ROI, and better business decisions.

We developed a chatbot for the Arizona Department of Economic Security (DES) to improve its Program Service Evaluator (PSE) training. The chatbot used Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services to answer PSE questions based on the policy manual of various state benefit programs. The chatbot learned from user feedback and crawled the policy content automatically. The chatbot increased evaluation efficiency, reduced senior staff time, and provided conversational responses to PSEs. The chatbot integrated seamlessly into the PSEs’ workflow and was accessible through a web interface and Skype for Business.

Our client, a leader in the energy and utilities sector, needed a scalable solution to analyze large volumes of IoT data from diverse applications. We used Power BI and Azure Data Explorer (ADX) to ingest, transform, and visualize semi-structured JSON data from network logs. Our solution reduced the data refresh time, handled dynamic schema changes, and enabled comprehensive analysis using Direct Query mode. Our client gained real-time insights and a competitive edge in the industry with our robust and effective solution. The solution also facilitated efficient data ingestion and transformation, effectively tackled issues pertaining to data refresh and dynamic schema of data.

We helped a multinational food and beverage chain to improve its sales forecasting accuracy by building a hybrid machine learning model on Azure Databricks. The model used historical sales, weather, and event data to predict future sales and analyze the impact of various factors on sales. The model also detected and explained seasonal and daily spikes and lag periods. Our model reduced the MAPE value from 0.13 to 0.09 and enabled the client to make better business decisions.
