Job Description


What the Data Services Team does at Visa:

At Visa, the Data Services Team plays a diverse and dynamic role with a strong emphasis on data management. The primary responsibility is to ensure the reliability and consistency of both inbound and outbound data. This involves proactive file queue management and technical analysis of any exceptions.

This role also prioritises the proactive management and resolution of customer and issuer incidents, upholding our team's reputation for quick and effective incident resolution, in accordance with Service Level Agreement (SLA) standards. Issues that affect the timeliness and accuracy of inbound or outbound transactional data loading are identified and proactively managed until resolution.

Effective Change Management is another key component of this role. The responsibility here is to facilitate seamless transitions, including the onboarding and offboarding of customers, issuers, and data feeds. The role requires frequent communication with customers, banks, and other transactional data issuers, managing the incoming data from these entities and the outgoing distribution of data. The objective is to build robust working relationships with these entities to ensure smooth transition processes.

While this summary outlines the main responsibilities, this role may also be asked to perform other specific tasks as needed. The ultimate goal is to cultivate a spirit of teamwork and collaboration, establishing an effective and efficient departmental operation in line with our team's mission. Occasionally, this position may require work outside of standard hours.

Why this is important to Visa

The Data Services team holds accountability for initiating data loading and delivery incidents with partners, and proactively notifying them about any failures. The team also manages operational relationships with data issuers and collaborates with them on behalf of our customers to fulfill requests.

As a core team in the business with expertise in data management, Data Services is involved in many internal exercises and projects. We play a critical role in configuring data loading components in production/UAT environments and transition for any new partner.

Given the service levels we need to meet with multiple partners, we have proactively created critical file failure processes to minimise the impact on our customers. While we work on Service Requests to add revenue to the business, we also generate billing opportunities that allow the Client Relationship teams to invoice partners for any requested data corrections.

This is a hybrid position. Hybrid employees can alternate time between both remote and office. Employees in hybrid roles are expected to work from the office 2-3 set days a week (determined by leadership/site), with a general guidepost of being in the office 50% or more of the time based on business needs.

At Amazon, we're working to be the most customer-centric company on earth. To get there, we need exceptionally talented, bright, innovative and driven leaders. If you'd like to help us build the place to find and buy anything on-line, this is your chance to make history and be intimately involved in growing our business by leading and supporting hourly staffing initiatives.

The vision of Workforce Intelligence is to design the ideal workforce to meet the customer promise anywhere. The Workforce Intelligence team applies data and insights to optimize the experience and operations for Amazon’s largest candidate population – Tier 1 Associates, who bring the magic of Amazon’s industry-leading Customer Fulfillment experience to life. The pace at which job creation and hiring must happen to support the scale and complexity of Amazon businesses is a problem Amazon is uniquely qualified to solve for and continually innovate on. Workforce Staffing (WFS) literally hires by the hundreds of thousands across multiple role times, job attributes, and for a range of business lines.

As a Data Engineer, you will provide technical leadership, lead data engineering initiatives and build end-to-end analytical solutions that are highly available, scalable, stable, secure, and cost-effective. You strive for simplicity, demonstrate creativity and sound judgement. You deliver data solutions that are customer focused, easy to consume and create business impact. You are passionate about working with huge datasets and have experience with the organization and curation of data for analytics. You have a strategic and long term view on architecting advanced data eco systems. You are experienced in building efficient and scalable data services and have the ability to integrate data systems with AWS tools and services to support a variety of customer use cases/applications.

In this role, you have the opportunity to:

Design, implement and operate large-scale, high-volume, high-performance data structures for analytics and data science.
Implement data ingestion routines both real time and batch using best practices in data modeling, ETL/ELT processes by leveraging AWS technologies and big data tools.
Gather business and functional requirements and translate these requirements into robust, scalable, operable solutions with a flexible and adaptable data architecture.
Collaborate with engineers to help adopt best practices in data system creation, data integrity, test design, analysis, validation, and documentation
Help continually improve ongoing reporting and analysis processes, automating or simplifying self-service modeling and production support for customers.
Key job responsibilities
As a Data Engineer with Workforce Intelligence, you will partner with Software Engineers, Data Scientists and Business Intelligence Engineers. You will gain a deep understanding of our services and the data they produce, and become our resident expert in how to transform that data into a format that is useful for analytics and business intelligence. You will proactively help to identify new data for integration with our platform, and propose and implement new technologies to help us better understand our data.

In this role, you will serve as the expert in designing, implementing, and operating a stable, scalable, low cost environment to flow information from the source systems to data warehouse into end-user facing reporting applications such as Tableau or AWS QuickSight. Above all, you will bring large datasets together to answer business questions and drive data-driven decision making.

About the team
The Workforce Intelligence team supports the Workforce Staffing organization by transforming data into insights on high volume hiring within Amazon. While WFS is responsible for the management of the Tier 1 talent supply chain, the Workforce Intelligence team in particular focuses on defining analytics that measure the performance of the program. While we continue to work on metrics that help monitor the health of the program we also spend efforts on identifying efficiencies in the process path through the power of data and predictive analytics.
