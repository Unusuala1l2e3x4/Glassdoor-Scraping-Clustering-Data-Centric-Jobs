Work collaboratively with stakeholders from multiple Chorus teams and contribute positively to team/org culture.
Design and build data pipelines, including: ETL into and out of our analytics data warehouse, a modern featurization stack that provides data to ML models with high recency and low latency, and building platforms that make key derived datasets available to various consumers (API, alerts services, models, etc.)
Lead data validation, monitoring, governance, lifecycle, and explainability initiatives.
Work cross-functionally to produce effective data models and architecture.
Plan (and code) for change (extensibility, schema evolution, etc.)
Design and build at system-level: Use of cloud technologies that gives maximum leverage while maintaining custom control where it matters, orchestration of various Chorus services to wrap universal ML models and other capabilities into tailored use case-specific apps.
Innovate and experiment with new technologies to unlock more data magic.

What You Should Have:

We are looking for a motivated and versatile Senior Software Engineer who is keen to build data-driven systems that will turn raw data into optimal decision making at scale.

Masters Degree in CS or equivalent practical experience.
Experience working cross functionally in dynamic environments (startups etc.).
4+ years of experience building data-intensive systems.
Very good in everyday use of SQL and Python, comfortable with Java when it pops up.
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines (ETL, ELT).
Experience building systems in the Cloud (AWS, Azure, we use GCP).

It would be great if you also had these:

Experience leading/managing cross functional projects.
Experience designing/managing data architectures and models.
Experience managing, administering, operating databases.
Experience with service-oriented architecture.
Familiarity/Experience with ML-driven systems and design patterns.
